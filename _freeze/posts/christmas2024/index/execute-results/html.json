This year, things have changed a little bit because of the introduction of some new hymns. So, in this post I'll give a brief look at what Christmas hymns are sung. It'll be similar in style to my ongoing post about [the second batch of new hymns](/posts/new_hymns_batch2), and I'll update it weekly until a negligible number of wards sing Christmas hymns. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, what proportion of wards are singing Christmas hymns? For now, I won't show a plot because it's only been one week, but I can summarize it in bullet points instead:\n\n* 96.4% of wards sang at least one Christmas hymn.\n* 12.5% of wards sang just one Christmas hymn.\n* 83.5% of wards sang two or more Christmas hymns. (There was one ward that did three---yes, even on Fast Sunday---because they sang two closing hymns, both of which were Christmas. I've never seen that before!)\n* 22.7% of wards sang one of the new hymns. The most common was <hymn>What Child Is This? (#1203)</hymn> by a fair margin, though see the figure below for some more detail. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## What Christmas hymns have been most popular?\n\nThe following plot shows which Christmas hymns have been most popular in December so far. About half have sung <hymn>Oh, Come, All Ye Faithful (#202)</hymn> and less than 5% have sung <hymn>While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks (#211)</hymn>. I'm hesitant to make any comparisons to last year quite yet since we're just one week into December and [some hymns are more popular earlier in the month than others](/posts/christmas/#trends-within-december). \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=624}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nInterspersed among these hymns are four new hymns. Of them, <hymn>What Child Is This? (#1203)</hymn> is far and away the most popular. The other three are towards the bottom, more popular than just two: <hymn>I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day (#214)</hymn> which tends to be most popular just before or even after Christmas, and <hymn>While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks (#211)</hymn> which has always been less popular.\n\nThe following table shows the same data plotted above but in table format so you can see the exact numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThat's it for now! Stay tuned for more updates each week this month!",
