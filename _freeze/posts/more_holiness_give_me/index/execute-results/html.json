I think I noticed this because my ward sang it and it's fun to see other wards singing the same hymns. But as I collected more and more data, an unusually large number of wards sang it as well! This brief post looks at this one hymn to see what's going on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut first, how common is <hymn>More Holiness Give Me (#131)</hymn> generally? I currently have data from 26,685 sacrament meetings. Of those, that hymn was sung in 526 of them, or about 1.97%. This comes out to about once every 1.06 years. It's the 46th most common hymn if you include sacrament hymns, or the 21st most common hymn excluding sacrament hymns. So, it's a pretty common hymn. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of data I have each week varies, but since June 2024, when my most recent data collection began in earnest, I've gotten data from an average of 130 sacrament meetings each week. That means we'd expect 2.56 of them to sing <hymn>More Holiness Give Me (#131)</hymn> each week if nothing interesting is happening. Sure enough, it was sung in only about 0--4 of those sacrament meetings each week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo then what happened on October 27? A whopping 12.4% sang <hymn>More Holiness Give Me (#131)</hymn>. That's 6.3 more often than normal. Here's what that looks like visually:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=624}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOkay, let's be real, that's not a tremendous amount. But, it's about once or twice per stake, which, for a hymn that otherwise only gets sung about once a year, is quite a jump.\n\nSo, why? Well, the most likely answer is that *Come, Follow Me* specifically mentions <hymn>More Holiness Give Me (#131)</hymn> as a good hymn to accompany 3 Nephi 28:1--11. It's very possible that many music coordinators saw that and chose it for sacrament meeting. Even if they didn't see it in the *Come, Follow Me* manual, the scriptures at the bottom of the hymn are related to the *Come, Follow Me* readings for this week. So, I think what we're seeing is that many music coordinators are getting ideas for hymns to be sung from the manual, which I think is a pretty cool thing. \n\n\n## Other *Come, Follow Me* Hymns?\n\nI happened to notice <hymn>More Holiness Give Me (#131)</hymn> this week, possibly because my own ward sang it. But, if it's the case that the reason why this was so popular this week is because of *Come, Follow Me*, perhaps there were other spikes on other Sundays that specifically mention hymns.\n\n\n* Oct 13: 169\n* Oct  6: 220\n* Sep 29: \n* Sep 22: \n* Sep 15: 125\n* Sep  8: 185\n* Sep  1:  98\n* Aug 25: 254\n* Aug 18: 250, 68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
