But, with the data I have, I can now provide some recommendations on how many of each digit a pack of cards has because have a pretty good idea of how many cards wards have had to use. So, let's take a look at what we can learn. This post is based on data from 22,573 wards prior to June 2 when the new hymns were released since those 1000s throw everything off!\n\n## Number of digits on display\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the distribution of numbers across all the hymns in these sacrament meetings. This table shows what percentage of the cards displayed belonged to each number.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"nwxnmypgnd\"

come as too much of a surprise that the most common digit is `1`. After all, the sacrament hymns all include at least one of them. I guess what's surprising is *just* how much more common it is. It's almost five times as common as `5` for some reason. We can plot these numbers. Here's a plot to show these visually, which highlights the difference between them. Interestingly, the numbers `7`--`9` are slightly more common, probably because they're used in the sacrament hymns which are hymns 169--196.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Which digits are most common?\n\nSo now what we can do is rather than look at all the data at once, we could look at each sacrament meeting individually. If a quarter of the cards used are `1`s, and the most number of cards used on a typical sacrament meeting is twelve (four hymns, each with three digits), then about three of them are predicted to be `1`s. Let's see what the data actually shows though.\n\nFirst off, the following plot shows the distribution how many cards are used each week. About 37% of meetings have nine digits on display. You'd see this if you didn't sing an intermediate hymn and all three hymns that were sung were hymn 100--341. Another 19% have eight digits, which would mean one of the three hymns is between 11 and 99. Just a few wards only displayed five digits, which happens when the opening and closing hymn are between `1` and `9` and a typical sacrament hymn.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe plot above shows that, once in a very great while, you might see a sacrament meeting with only four cards used. This happened twice in my dataset. Both from the same ward in American Fork in March 2021. On one week, they sang <hymn>Dearest Children, God Is Near You (#96)</hymn> as the sacrament hymn and on the next week, they sang <hymn>For the Beauty of the Earth (#92)</hymn> as the sacrament hymn. It is [very unusual](/posts/sacrament) to sing anything outside of hymns 169--196. But, as rare as it is to do that, what makes these doubly unusual is that both the opening and closing hymns were one of the nine hymns between `1` and `9`. That means only four digits were on display. Pretty cool. Not sure what was going on in that ward, but it's pretty cool that I caught it happening.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing back to the individual digits, we can now go back and see how many of each are on display each week in a ward. I looked through all the sacrament meetings I have data from, and counted up how many of each digit was on display. I then took the average across all meetings. Those averages are displayed in this plot below. I know it's nonsensical to think of 2.2 cards, but these are averages after all. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## How many cards of each digit do we need?\n\nThe above plot is the same as the one above that showed the proportion of numbers on display across all meetings. So, let's make it more useful. What if we consider a different question. How many copies of each digit should come in a standard pack distributed by the church? You probably don't need twelve of each number because you're never going to sing hymn 111 four times. But you want more than what the numbers in the above plot show, because it means half the time you won't have enough. \n\nWhat I've done is looked at how many copies of each digit are needed to account for 95% of sacrament meetings. Those numbers are displayed below. What this plot shows is that if you have four `1`s and `2`s, three `0`s, `3`s, `7`s, and `9`s, and two `4`s, `5`s, `6`s, and `8`s, you would have enough cards 95% of the time. That means it's only about every two years that you'd run out of cards. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowevever, once every two years is still more often that you'd want. Perhaps what we'd want is to be good 99% of the time. The plot below shows those numbers. This time, you'd need five `1`s and `2`s, four `3`s, and three of everything else. That would ensure you're good to go almost all the time and maybe once every five years would you run out. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPerhaps that's sufficient. But maybe not. For the sake of curiosity, how many cards would it take to cover *all* the sacrament meetings I have data for? The plot below shows those numbers. You'd need a whopping eight `1`s, seven `2`s, six each of `3`s, `6`s, and `7`s, and five of everything else. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor the `1`s, yes, there was a sacrament meeting that used eight of them. It was a ward in Maryland in 2017 and they sang <hymn>Rock of Ages (#111)</hymn>, <hymn>Again, Our Dear Redeeming Lord (#179)</hymn>, <hymn>I'm a Pilgrim, I'm a Stranger (#121)</hymn>, and <hymn>Our Savior's Love (#113)</hymn>. So, nothing particularly special I don't think, but it just so happens that they had a lot of `1`s. They could theoretically have had a ninth `1` if they had sung <hymn>With Humble Heart (#171)</hymn>, <hymn>Jesus of Nazareth, Savior and King (#181)</hymn>, or <hymn>Behold the Great Redeemer Die (#191)</hymn> as the sacrament hymn. So I think the most you'd see for any number is nine. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo sacrament meetings used seven `2`s. This was mostly done by singing multiple hymns in the 220-229 range. But the most possible I suppose would be eight, if you sang the rather unusual hymn <hymn>Hear Thou Our Hymn, O Lord (#222)</hymn>, a sacrament hymn ending in `2`, and two others each with two `2`s. I saw six threes one time; it was around the 4th of July and they sang <hymn>America the Beautiful (#338)<hymn> and <hymn>My Country, 'Tis of Thee (#339)</hymn>, and both of the other hymns had one three in it. Unless you're singing the Men's Choir version of <hymn>High on the Mountain Top (#333)</hymn> or another hymn in the 330s, it's only really possible to get just one more, for a maximum of seven. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause we don't have hymns 444, 555, etc., you can't get as many of the other digits. For `4`s--`9`s, you could in theory sing something like 44, 174, 144, and 244, which would be seven, but that would be pretty unusual. The closest I had was a ward in 2022 in Maryland that sang <hymn>As I Search the Holy Scriptures (#277)</hymn>, <hymn>'Tis Sweet to Sing the Matchless Love (#177)</hymn>, <hymn>Oh, Holy Words of Truth and Love (#271)</hymn> and <hymn>The Iron Rod (#274)</hymn>. I also had a ward in St. George that sang <hymn>Redeemer of Israel (#6)</hymn>, <hymn>As Now We Take the Sacrament (#169)</hymn>, <hymn>Abide with Me! (#166)</hymn>, and <hymn>Rejoice, the Lord Is King! (#66)</hymn>. I have no instance of a sacrament meeting that had more than five `4`s, `5`s, `8`s, or `9`s. \n\n## So how many cards should we put in a pack?\n\nIn my building, there are six cards for each number. I don't know if that's a standard set you'd get from Distribution, but it's probably similar to many other buildings. While it's theoretically possible to use all six of the higher numbers, as we've seen so far, that is extremely rare. Less than one in 25,638 sacrament meetings. I'll bet we could get away with putting only five cards for the numbers `4`--`9` and hardly anyone would ever need more than that.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, though still extremely rare, I do have instances of wards that would have run out of some numbers. In just 14 sacrament meetings (0.05%), a ward needed more than six `1`s. And in two sacrament meetings (0.008%), they ran out of `2`s. \n\nSo, I wonder if we should distribute maybe five `4`--`9`s and `0`s, six `3`s, and eight `1`-`2`s. That'd be a couple less cards than what comes in a standard pack now and would still cover almost everything that I've seen. We could even cut it down to five `1`--`3`s, and three of everything else and that'd still cover over 99% of sacrament meetings! \n\nOf course all this goes out the window with the new hymns because they're temporarily in the thousands, so we'll need more `1`s and `0`s. And when the next hymnal comes out, all the numbers will be adjusted again depending on how many hymns we have (we'll most likely have a hymn 444 for example) and where within the hymnal the sacrament hymns are (I'm thinking in the 200-250 range most likely). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
