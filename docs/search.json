    "section": "A brief note about my calculations",
    "text": "A brief note about my calculations\nLet me first mention my methods for how I’m calculating how often a hymn is sung, on average, per ward. I currently have data from 18,369 sacrament meetings. A ward will meet together for sacrament meeting usually 48 times in a year (52 weeks minus two for General Conference and minus two for Stake Conference). 18,369 meetings divided by 48 meetings in a year is about 382 years’ worth of sacrament meetings—far more than any one person could attend in their lifetime. So, if there’s a hymn that’s sung in just one of those sacrament meetings, that means it’s sung, on average per ward, once every 382 years. If a hymn is sung 100 times in my dataset, it’s sung on average once every 18369 / 48 / 100 = 3.82 years per ward.\nBecause I’m dealing with very sparse numbers in this post, the numbers may fluctuate wildly. As I collect more data, the exact numbers jump around quite a bit when we get to the very infrequent hymns. For example, if a hymn is sung three times in my dataset, that comes out to once every 127 years. If it’s sung just twice, it’s once every 191 years. That’s a big jump for a single data point. So, you should take these numbers with a grain of salt they mostly reflect how much data I have. Instead, I’ll group them into broad categories of “once a decade,” “once a generation,” and “once in a lifetime.”\nPlease note that I have removed the men’s and women’s arrangements (hymns 309–337) from these lists because, as I’ve already written, they’re probably not really intended or appropriate for sacrament meeting.\nSo, with that in mind, let’s most on to the least common hymns."

I like to think of The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37) as being “famous for not being famous,” particularly among LDS musicians, and with its high melody and tenor lines, unusual chords, and potentially offensive lyrics, it’s no surprise that it’s not sung very often. Some of these hymns are ones that the Tabernacle Choir sings but that I otherwise don’t recognize. Most of the hymns in the first half the hymnal, I hardly recognize at all. Meanwhile, the ones in the second half of the hymnal are ones that I recognize only because they’re interspersed among some of the more common, upbeat hymns in the 200-range. Overall, there is nothing too surprising here: there aren’t any hymns that I feel like are more popular than they really are."

Another way of thinking about these is that in the lifetime of a physical copy of a hymnal, there is a decent chance that most of these nine hymns were never sung.\nI recognize two of these hymns because they stand out in interesting ways. First, is Lean on My Ample Arm (120) which is my favorite hymn. There’s also Softly Now the Light of Day (160) which, at only two lines and one verse, is tied with the once-every-six-years Praise God, from Whom All Blessings Flow (242) for the shortest hymn in the hymnal..If you want to get really technical, Hymn 242 is shorter because its suggested tempo marking includes slower tempos.\nOthers in this list can be explained a little bit.\n\nHere we get the other hymn in D♭, Softly Beams the Sacred Dawning (56).\nWe Meet Again in Sabbath School (282) makes sense for being on this list because it’s likely intended to be an opening hymn for Sunday School, and not sacrament meeting. Although, we don’t start Sunday School with hymns anymore, so it’s likely not getting any currency anymore.\nThe hymn Come, Let Us Sing an Evening Hymn (167) makes sense since most wards meet in the morning.\nIt’s also not surprising that God Save the King (341) is hardly sung in my sample, partially because I don’t have a lot of data from the UK and the reigning monarch the entire time was a queen rather than a king.\nFinally, it seems like This House We Dedicate to Thee (#245) is intended for a building dedication which probably not very many people actually get to attend in their lifetimes. It’s a perfectly good hymn and very appropriate for the occasion—but regular sacrament meeting is not such an occasion.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, we actually sang God Save the King (#341) in Priesthood Opening Exercises, back when they had those. We did it becauase one of the young women from the ward was sitting in because she needed to make an announcement, so the Bishop asked her to give the prayer, because, how often do you see a young woman give the opening prayer in a Priesthood meeting? So, while we’re seeing things we’ve never seen before, we sang God Save the King (#341).It is interesting to note that, with a large enough sample and if you ignore the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back, I was able to find evidence of every hymn being sung at least once in some meeting somewhere."

    "text": "Overall Frequency\nTo me, it is wild to think that these 17 hymns (plus many of the men’s and women’s arrangements) have been printed in tens of thousands of hymnals for the past nearly 40 years and have hardly ever been used by anyone. On the plus side, these lists are somewhat small, especially the list of hymns never sung at all. It appears to be the case then that pretty much every hymn is sung at least a little bit. So, inflated claims along the lines of “there are 100 hymns that literally no one sings” simply aren’t accurate. They’re not common, but they are sung.\nIn fact, if we take all 67 hymns that I’ve listed on this page, and count up how many times they were sung, it comes out to 1,180 times in this sample, which is 1.85% of all the data. That means you might sing one of these 67 hymns once every four months, or about as often as I Stand All Amazed (193). Another way of thinking about it is that we could cut these 67 hymns, and it would affect about one meeting every four months.\nPerhaps a better way of looking at this is to think about how many wards sing a given hymn around the world. There are around 31,330 wards and branches across the world. Let’s say that the 18,369 meetings I have data are a representative sample with one ward contributing data all in the same week. That would be 58.6% of the congregations around the whole world. If one of them sings something like Sons of Michael, He Approaches (#51), we might therefore assume that perhaps maybe one other congregation around the world will sing that hymn in a given week. For comparison, if we apply the same logic, I Stand All Amazed (#193) would be sung in 1,755 different congregations every week.See more facts and figures published by the church here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should take that claim about how many wards around the world sing these hymns with a monster grain of salt for at least the following reasons:\n\nThe wards I have data from are not representative of units across the world. Roughly 85% of my data comes from the US, for example, while less than half the congregations in the world come from the US.\nWe can’t assume the 18,369 meetings are independent of each other because most wards contributed data from more than one sacrament meeting. So we can’t interpret them as coming from 18,369 independent wards in the same week.\nAs we’ll see in later posts, holidays matter, and the likelihood of singing any one hymn goes up and down depending on things like holidays, Fast Sundays, and proximity to General Conference. So the odds of singing these unusual hymns is basically zero the week before Christmas, but slightly higher in a random week in September or something.\nAlso, the type of music coordinators that keep spreadsheets are likely the ones who try to diversify the hymns they sing. There are likely many wards who do not have spreadsheets and may sing from a more limited selection throughout the year.\n\nI wanted to point out these caveats, but it’s still interesting to think about how many times these hymns are sung around the world on a given Sunday."

    "text": "Concluding thoughts\nIn this blog post, I took a closer look at hymns that are sung at most once a decade. Many of them were sung less often that that, if they were sung at all.\nBut should we cut these hymns? Unless there are issues with the text, message, or doctrine, I don’t see any reason why we should remove hymns per se. In fact, some hymns, like We Meet Again in Sabbath School (#282) or This House We Dedicate to Thee (#245) are/were quite appropriate in very specific, albeit infrequent, circumstances. So, should they be printed in tens of thousands of hymnals? In my opinion, probably not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for the next hymnal\n\n\n\nPut these special hymns into an online supplement to the hymnal, like what I recommend for the men’s and women’s arrangements. Make it clear that these are approved for use in the church and part of the “canon” but are simply not printed for practical reasons.\nAs for the special hymns that are useful for certain occasions, set them aside in a section called “special occasions” or something that would catch people’s attention. We don’t want them to be overlooked when those special occasions do arise. It would be a shame to lose these hymns simply because the occasions they are written for don’t happen very often.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation to music coordinators\n\n\n\nIt is unlikely that many people in your ward will be familiar with more than a few hymns listed on this page. If you want to be adventurous and try a really uncommon hymm, these are the ones to choose from. But, it might be good to help the ward out a little bit by having the ward choir sing it first, having the organist play it for prelude a few weeks prior, having the organist play the entire hymn as an introduction, and having the organist use play the melody on the swell (or use a melody coupler) with a reed stop pulled to make it easier to hear.\nRegardless of whether you use these hymns, you should get familiar with these techniques for introducing hymns to ward members because we’ll all likely need to start using them when we get the new hymnal anyway.\n\n\nFunny story. Someone contributed a couple years’ worth of data from their ward and I mentioned that they sang three of the most unusual hymns in the span of two weeks. The sister wrote back saying the music coordinator was released right after that and she was called with a special request from her bishop to sing songs people were familiar with. So, if you go too overboard, it might cost you your calling!If you have sung one of these 67 hymns recently in your ward, that’s pretty cool because few people can sasy they have!"
