    "text": "Someone in your ward likely keeps a spreadsheet that has the past few weeks/months/years of hymns sung in sacrament meeting in your ward. This is typically shared between the music chairperson, chorister(s), organist(s), and a bishopric member. If you or someone close to you has access to that spreadsheet, you can simply send a copy to me. This is probably the best way to contribute to this project.\nIf you have a collection of old sacrament meeting programs from your ward, either digital or physical, those usually list the hymns that were sung that week. (I know hardly anyone carries physical scriptures anymore, but look through those to see if there are any old ones tucked away in there!) You can either write down the information from those programs onto a new spreadsheet or document and send me that, or just send me copies of the programs themselves.\nStart keeping track yourself. Make a note on your phone and add to it each week. Or just shoot me an email each week too.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if the sacrament meeting info you send me is recent or not. One ward sent me information from 2003! It also doesn’t matter if there are gaps in your contribution. So if you have data from 2018 and then more from 2023 but missed the years in between, that’s totally fine!\nAny amount of data helps—even if it’s just from a single week or two! Again, email whatever contributions you have to hymnstats@gmail.com and I’ll incorporate it into the analysis as quickly as I can!"

    "text": "Welcome to the LDS Hymn Stats project! The purpose of this project is to discover what hymns are most commonly sung generally and in certain times of the year in sacrament meetings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have gathered information on what hymns were sung in over 5,000 sacrament meetings from around the world over the past 20 years. This site gives some of the more important findings; I am writing a short book that contains more detailed results."

    "text": "Project Overview\nHave you ever wondered what the most common hymn is in sacrament meeting? I can tell you right now: it’s I Stand All Amazed (193) and it’s sung, on average, once every four and a half months in a given ward. What hymn is least common? Well, that’s a trickier question to answer, but if you ignore the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal, some of the least common hymns in sacrament meeting are Sons of Michael, He Approaches (51), This House We Dedicate to Thee (245), Go, Ye Messengers of Glory (262), and God Save the King (341).\nWhat is the most popular Christmas hymn? It looks like it’s Joy to the World (201). If that matches your intuition, then that’s good news because it’s means I’ve got good data! But, what is the most popular Mother’s Day hymn? Thanksgiving? Valentine’s Day?\nWith this project, I have been able to answer some of these simpler questions, but I’ve also been able to uncover some subtler patterns as well. Like, what Christmas hymns are typically sung the third Sunday in December? (The First Noel (213) might be the most likely.) On the Sunday after Thanksgiving (in the United States), do people sing more Thanksgiving hymns, Christmas hymns, or neither? Are there “unofficial” sacrament hymns that are sung more than any of the “official” ones? What percentage of wards outside of Utah (but still in the US) sing Pioneer Day hymns around Pioneer Day?\nI’ve also uncovered some of what might go through a music chairperson’s head as they select what hymns are to be sung in their ward. It seems like the more popular Christmas hymns are reserved for Sundays when it is anticipated that the most number of people will be in attendance, and the less popular ones are used during peak travel dates. Even though the entry for “Thanksgiving” in topic index in the back of the hymnal directs readers to the “Gratitude” for more hymns, very few people actually use those gratitude-themed hymns around Thanksgiving. Easter hymns trump both General Conference– and Fast Sunday–themed hymns in April, and Fourth of July trumps Fast Sunday hymns.\nFurthermore, I’ve been able to uncover patterns that say something interesting about Mormon culture. For example, Mother’s Day hymns are typically about earthly mothers while Father’s Day hymns are about Heavenly Father. Enough Utahns have relocated to other parts of the US that Pioneer Day may be considered a de facto LDS holiday. And a decent number of wards systematically cycle through the 28 sacrament hymns, sometimes for years without any deviation.\nAs a secondary part of this project, I’m also addressing questions about the music of the hymns. What hymn has the highest melody note? Well, if you exclude the women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal and the optional note at the end of Carry On (255), it the F# in the rarely-sung Lean on My Ample Arm (120). What part has the narrowest range? What is the most common key signature? How many hymns could you sing the tenor line for if you can only go up to a Bb? What is the most common final chord? How many hymns don’t end on “do”? How many add9 chords are there in the hymnal?"

What qualifies me for this project are my skills in data analysis and vizualiation, as well as my sheer interest in the project.\nI’m motivated to complete this project soon because the church will soon release a new hymnal, at which point all of my data will be obsolete. I hope that I can get these results out there so that people can use it help them with their callings, so the church can use it when designing the new hymnal, and to provide a snapshot of hymn usage data before the 1985 hymnal is phased out.\nIf you would like to contribute to the project, please see the contribute tab above."
