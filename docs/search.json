    "text": "So how many hymns do wards sing per year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nMost wards sing around 107 unique hymns per year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical details for nerds :)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get this number, I started off with the 20 wards from which I have at least a year’s worth of data. I didn’t want to base the calculation on wards that contributed less data because it messes with the results.\nBut, even with these 20 wards, I can’t simply divide the number of unique hymns by the number of sacrament meetings because the more data I have from a ward, the more likely they are to sing a rather unusual hymn. It pretty neatly follows some sort of exponential distribution.\n\nSo, because of math, it’s not meaningful to compare six years of data from one ward to one year of data from another ward.\nI tried a rolling cumulative sum of unique hymns, but I didn’t know how to implement that in R. So instead, I implemented a bootstrapping technique and sampled 48 meetings, without replacement, 100 times per ward, and got that average. The standard deviation was 3.68—a surprisingly narrow distribution if you ask me.\n\n\n\nAssuming about 24–28 of those are sacrament hymns, that means most wards only sing about 80 or so unique non-sacrament hymns per year. Furthermore, 28 of those 80 hymns are repeated each year.\nThe most variety of hymns I have in my dataset is 130 unique hymns per ward. That’s pretty good, and certainly much better than average. The year with the least variety was one ward that sang just 90 unique hymns in a year. Considering that many of the holiday hymns aren’t going to be repeated, it means that many (and perhaps most) of the non-festive hymns were repeated that year.\nThese numbers should be taken with a grain of salt because it’s only based on 20 wards. If you have access to a year’s worth of data from your ward, please visit the contribute page!"

    "text": "In addition to collecting data on how often hymns are sung in sacrament meeting, I have also gone through the rather painstaking process of quantifying all the actual music of the hymns. What I mean is that for every part (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) for every hymn, I went through and wrote down the pitch and duration of every note in a spreadsheet. With this music now reduced down to numbers, I can analyze it quantitatively. This post is the first of many that will present a numeric analysis of the music of the hymns themselves. I’ve started with the soprano line since it’s what is most familiar to most people, but I’ll eventually do similar posts on alto, tenor, and bass lines as well."

    "section": "Highest melody notes",
    "text": "Highest melody notes\nThe first question we can ask is this: what is the highest note a melody goes up to?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe highest (non-optional) melody note is an F♯5, which is found in Lean on My Ample Arm (120).\n\n\nThat of course excludes the optional G5 at the end of Carry On (255). What’s worse about the the F♯5 in Lean on My Ample Arm (120) is that it’s a sustained note—there’s nowhere to hide! However, it is very unlikely that you’ll sing it in church. In all the data I have, it was only sung four times, which means it’s sung about once every 29 years. Another way of putting it is that the hymn is sung in sacrament meeting about once a generation. So, if you can’t quite reach that F♯5, don’t worry because you will likely never need to.For what it’s worth, a combined choir from BYU sang it in General Conference in April 2008 and it was beautiful.\nWell then, what is a typical highest note for a soprano line?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe majority of hymns have D5 as their highest note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighest Note\nNumber of Hymns\nPercentage of Hymnal\n\n\n\n\nAb4\n2\n0.61%\n\n\nBb4\n1\n0.31%\n\n\nB4\n2\n0.61%\n\n\nC5\n30\n9.17%\n\n\nC#5\n6\n1.83%\n\n\nD5\n164\n50.15%\n\n\nEb5\n62\n18.96%\n\n\nE5\n54\n16.51%\n\n\nF5\n5\n1.53%\n\n\nF#5\n1\n0.31%\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are another five hymns that have melody lines that go up to an F5. But, as seen below, the only one that is moderately common is The Morning Breaks (1). The others are sung so infrequently, that their presence in sacrament meetings is negligible. Great Is the Lord (77) was sung just four times in my sample and both The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37) and Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (118) were each sung only twice. And Sweet Is the Work (317) is a women’s choir arrangement so, as I’ve discussed already, it’s not sung very much.\n\nHymns with melodies that go up to an F5\n\n\nHymn\nHow often it’s sung\n\n\n\n\nThe Morning Breaks (1)\nOnce every 3.5 years\n\n\nGreat Is the Lord (77)\nOnce every 30 years\n\n\nThe Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37)\nOnce every 60 years\n\n\nYe Simple Souls Who Stray (118)\nOnce every 60 years\n\n\nSweet Is the Work (317)\nNever?\n\n\n\nSo, six of the 341 hymns on our current hymnal go up to an F5 or F♯5, which is 1.76% of the hymnal. If all hymns were sung equally often as each other, we’d then expect that 1.76% of sacrament meeting hymns to go up to an F5 or F♯5. In reality, only 0.24% of them do, which means these six hymns are less common than expected. On average, you’ll encounter one maybe once every two and a half years. And if you do, three-quarters of the time it’ll be The Morning Breaks (1).\nI can’t help but wonder whether that high melody note is the reason these hymns are so uncommon. It may be the case that they are unusual hymns anyway that for whatever reason are not sung very often. But I think that these hymns are uncommon at least partially because of these high notes. A music chairperson might consider selecting one of these for their ward to sing in sacrament meeting, but for the sake of everyone’s voices, ultimately decides against it. Thus, the high note perpetuates the rarity of the hymn. We saw this with the key signatures as well: hymns with marginally-attested phenomena (in this case, the keys of A and Db) are rarer than they would be due to chance alone."

Once we start looking at the E5 and E♭5 territory, there are many more hymns that include notes in that range, and some of those hymns are pretty common.\nThere are 54 hymns have E5 as the highest note in their melody, including some of the more common ones like High on the Mountain Top (5), Our Savior’s Love (113), Let Us All Press On (243), and Praise to the Man (27). Collectively, these 54 hymns make up 15.84% of the hymnal. 12.21% of the hymns sung in my sample of sacrament meetings are one of these 54, so you’ll see an E5 about once every 2.5 weeks. The following figure shows these hymns in order of frequency and how often they’re sung.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as hymns that have E♭5 as the highest note, there are 58 of them, or 18.18% of the hymns.

    "text": "Hymns where the melody doesn’t go very high\nThe remaining 13% of the hymns have melodies that don’t go as high. There are only 6 that go up to a C♯ or D♭, including Because I Have Been Given Much (219). The figure below shows all of them and how often they occur. It’s interesting that even though there are six hymns that fall into this category, two are sacrament hymns and one is a very common one. So even though they make up just 1.76% of the hymnal, they make up about 2.65% of the hymns sung in church. You’re likely to see one every 11 or so weeks on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think there are relatively few that have this particular note simply because of what key signatures are most common. It’s probably not a coincidence that one of the two hymns in D♭ are in this category. Most of the others are in A♭. If there were more hymns in D♭ major, or even A♭ we might see more hymns where the highest note is D♭5.\nAnother 30 hymns only go as high as a C5, including Choose the Right (239) and Come, Follow Me (116). They make up 8.8% of the hymnal but 11.7% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are five hymns don’t ever go higher than the middle of the treble clef. The two that only go to a B4 are both pretty well known: Secret Prayer (144) and Lead, Kindly Light (197). The only one that has B♭4 as the highest note is for men, Ye Who Are Called to Labor (321), so it might not even count as a “soprano” note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe lowest highest melody note is an A♭4, which is found in the rare God Moves in a Mysterious Way (285) and the extremely rare Now the Day is Over (159).\n\n\nThese two hymns are low enough that even a good tenor could sing the melody in the right octave! In total, there are just five hymns that don’t reach a C5, which is only 1.5% of the hymnal. And they’re rarer hymns, so they only make up 0.72% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting. So, if your highest note is a B, you might be able to sing melody once every 10 months or so. At least these lower hymns are more common that the hymns that go up to an F5 or F♯5!"

The lowest highest note in the soprano line is an A♭4.\nPersonally, singing above about a B is not easy for me. So, if I were in charge, I’d selfishly transpose many of these hymns down a bit so that their highest note is in a more comfortable range for me. But, I know many other people have no problem singing a D or even an E, so I’m not recommending that the hymnal lower any of these hymns."

    "text": "A brief note about my calculations\nLet me first mention my methods for how I’m calculating how often a hymn is sung, on average, per ward. I currently have data from 6,122 sacrament meetings. A ward will meet together for sacrament meeting usually 48 times in a year (52 weeks minus two for General Conference and minus two for Stake Conference). 6,122 meetings divided by 48 meetings in a year is about 127 years’ worth of sacrament meetings—more than any one person would likely attend in their lifetime, even if you doubled up for a couple decades. So, if there’s a hymn that’s sung in just one of those sacrament meetings, that means it’s sung, on average per ward, once every 127 years. If a hymn is sung 100 times in my dataset, it’s sung on average once every 6122 / 48 / 100 = 1.27 years per ward.\nBecause I’m dealing with very sparse numbers in this post, the numbers may fluctuate wildly. So for example, a hymn that’s sung in three of my sacrament meetings comes out to an average of once every 42.5 years. Meanwhile a hymns that’s sung in just two of them is once every 63.8 years. That’s a big jump for a single data point. So, what I’m saying is you should take these numbers with a large grain of salt they mostly reflect how much data I have. Instead, I’ll group them into broad categories of “once a decade,” “once a generation,” and “once in a lifetime.”\nPlease note that I have removed the men’s and women’s arrangements (hymns 309–337) from these lists because, as I’ve already written, they’re probably not really intended or appropriate for sacrament meeting.\nSo, with that in mind, let’s most on to the least common hymns."

First, is Lean on My Ample Arm (120) which is my favorite hymn. There’s Softly Now the Light of Day (160) which, at only two lines and one verse, is tied with the once-every-seven-years Praise God, from Whom All Blessings Flow (242) for the shortest hymn in the hymnal.. There’s also As the Shadows Fall (168), which I recognize because it’s one of only two hymns in the key of D♭. As far as the rest go, I don’t even recognize the titles for a lot of them.If you want to get really technical, Hymn 242 is shorter because its suggested tempo marking includes slower tempos.\nThe wild thing is that the current hymnal was published in 1985, which is 38 years ago. If these numbers are accurate, it means that these hymns might have been sung maybe once or twice in the entire lifetime of the hymnal!"

Again, keep in mind that because I’m dealing with such sparse data, saying something is sung once every 127 years is very approximate and just reflects how much data I have total.

Another way of thinking about these is that in the lifetime of a physical copy of a hymnal, there is a decent chance that most of these nine hymns were ever sung.\nSome of these can be explained a little bit.\n\nHere we get the other hymn in D♭, Softly Beams the Sacred Dawning (56).\nI like to describe The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37) as being “famous for not being famous,” particularly among LDS musicians, and with its high melody and tenor lines, unusual chords, and potentially offensive lyrics, it’s no surprise that it’s not sung very often.\nWe Meet Again in Sabbath School (282) makes sense for being on this list because it’s likely intended to be an opening hymn for Sunday School, and not sacrament meeting. Although, we don’t start Sunday School with hymns anymore, so it’s likely not getting any currency anymore.\nThe hymn Come, Let Us Sing an Evening Hymn (167) makes sense since most wards meet in the morning.\nIt’s also not surprising that God Save the King (341) isn’t represented in my sample, partially because I only have data from a single ward in the United Kingdom, and while it was several years’ worth, it is just one ward and the reigning monarch the entire time was a queen rather than a king.\nFinally, it seems like This House We Dedicate to Thee (245) is intended for a building dedication which probably not very many people actually get to attend in their lifetimes. It’s a perfectly good hymn and very appropriate for the occasion—but regular sacrament meeting is not such an occasion."

    "text": "Overall Frequency\nTo me, it is wild to think that these 18 hymns (plus many of the men’s and women’s arrangements) have been printed in tens of thousands of hymnals for the past nearly 40 years and have hardly ever been used by anyone. On the plus side, these lists are somewhat small, especially the list of hymns never sung at all. It appears to be the case then that pretty much every hymn is sung at least a little bit. So, inflated claims along the lines of “there are 100 hymns that literally no one sings” simply aren’t accurate. They’re not common, but they are sung.\nIn fact, if we take all 65 hymns that I’ve listed on this page, and count up how many times they were sung, it comes out to 363 times in this sample, which is 1.78% of all the data. That means you might sing one of these 65 hymns once every four months, or about as often as I Stand All Amazed (193). Another way of thinking about it is that we could cut these 65 hymns, and it would affect about one meeting every four months.\nPerhaps a better way of looking at this is to think about how many wards sing a given hymn around the world. There are around 31,330 wards and branches across the world. Let’s say that the 6,122 meetings I have data from are a representative sample. That’s 19.5% of the congregations around the whole world. If one of them sings something like Like Ten Thousand Legions Marching (253), we might therefore assume that perhaps five congregations around the world will sing that hymn in a given week. For comparison, if we apply the same logic, I Stand All Amazed (193) would be sung in 1,857 different congregations every week.See more facts and figures published by the church here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should take that claim about how many wards around the world sing these hymns with a monster grain of salt for at least the following reasons:\n\nThe wards I have data from are not representative of units across the world. Roughly 75% of my data comes from the US, for example, while less than half the congregations in the world come from the US.\nWe can’t assume the 5,659 meetings are independent of each other because most wards contributed data from more than one sacrament meeting. So we can’t interpret them as coming from 5,659 independent wards in the same week.\nAs we’ll see in later posts, holidays matter, and the likelihood of singing any one hymn goes up and down depending on things like holidays, Fast Sundays, and proximity to General Conference. So the odds of singing these unusual hymns is basically zero the week before Christmas, but slightly higher in a random week in September or something.\nAlso, the type of music coordinators that keep spreadsheets are likely the ones who try to diversify the hymns they sing. There are likely many wards who do not have spreadsheets and may sing from a more limited selection throughout the year.\n\nI wanted to point out these caveats, but it’s still interesting to think about how many times these hymns are sung around the world on a given Sunday."

Many of them were sung less often that that, if they were sung at all.\nBut should we cut these hymns? Unless there are issues with the text, message, or doctrine, I don’t see any reason why we should remove hymns per se. In fact, some hymns, like We Meet Again in Sabbath School (282) or This House We Dedicate to Thee (245) are/were quite appropriate in very specific, albeit infrequent, circumstances. So, should they be printed in tens of thousands of hymnals? In my opinion, probably not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for the next hymnal\n\n\n\nPut these special hymns into an online supplement to the hymnal, like what I recommend for the men’s and women’s arrangements. Make it clear that these are approved for use in the church and part of the “canon” but are simply not printed for practical reasons.\nAs for the special hymns that are useful for certain occasions, set them aside in a section called “special occasions” or something that would catch people’s attention. We don’t want them to be overlooked when those special occasions do arise. It would be a shame to lose these hymns simply because the occasions they are written for don’t happen very often.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation to music coordinators\n\n\n\nIt is unlikely that many people in your ward will be familiar with more than a few hymns listed on this page. If you want to be adventurous and try a really uncommon hymm, these are the ones to choose from. But, it might be good to help the ward out a little bit by having the ward choir sing it first, having the organist play it for prelude a few weeks prior, having the organist play the entire hymn as an introduction, and having the organist use play the melody on the swell (or use a melody coupler) with a reed stop pulled to make it easier to hear.\nRegardless of whether you use these hymns, you should get familiar with these techniques for introducing hymns to ward members because we’ll all likely need to start using them when we get the new hymnal anyway.\n\n\nIf you have sung one of these 65 hymns recently in your ward, that’s pretty cool because few people can sasy they have!"

    "text": "But do we actually see G major the most?\nSo we’ve addressed the question of what key signature the most number of hymns are set to. But, does that actually mean that’s the most that we see? What’s the difference? It may be the case that tons of hymns in G major are really obscure ones that hardly anyone ever sees. So, if we take frequency into account, perhaps another key is seen more often, even if fewer hymns are actually in it.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Likelihood of key signatures\n\n\nFigure 2 looks similar to Figure 1 except I’ve adjusted the heights of the bars based on how frequent each hymn is. If a hymn is more common, it’ll raise the bar for its key signature more. If it’s less common, it’ll raise it less.\nWhile superficially the two plots may look similar, there are some important differences. (See Table 1 as well.) First, D major is closer in height to G major. While only about 15.6% of the hymns are in D, they’re sung about 19.3% of the time. This is likely due to some pretty common sacrament hymns like Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (196), O God, the Eternal Father (175), and In Memory of the Crucified (190) as well as some other heavy hitters like I Believe in Christ (134) and We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19).\nMost of the other key signatures are pretty similar. C major and F major are more or less unchanged. Though 12.3% of hymns are set in Bb major, they’re only sung about 9.3% of the time. And while Ab major is only used in 6.4% of the hymns, it’s sung 5.2% of the time in sacrament meeting. (No doubt, I Stand All Amazed (193) is doing the lion’s share of the work there.)\nPerhaps the biggest change is that Eb is quite a bit more commonly seen than you’d expect based on how many hymns there are in it. 14.3% of hymns are in Eb, but 17.4% of the hymns actually sung in sacrament meeting are in Eb. Undoubtedly, it’s because nine of the 28 sacrament hymns are in Eb. So, to put it another way, on average, hymns in Eb major are more common than hymns in C major or even Bb major.\nFinally, the fact that the keys of A and Db major are mere slivers in Figure 2 reflects what was explained above that they’re really uncommon.\nTo put some numbers to this, interestingly, still 22% of hymns that are actually sung in sacrament meeting are in the key of G. D jumps The keys of D, C, F, Bb, and Eb each have 12%–15% of the hymns. Ab is less common, with about 6% of the hymns.\nFigure 2 probably has the most useful application out of anything else in this blog post. If you’re a budding musician and are still getting used to key signatures, the good news is that you don’t have to learn all twelve keys to play the hymnal.

    "text": "Why is G major the most common?\nI’m not a musicologist, but I can speculate as to why G is more common than C. It may be the case that many melodies are centered around the tonic, and extend roughly a fifth above it and roughly a fourth or fifth below it, with a total range of about an octave. If that’s the case, a comfortable octave for many singers is from D to D, which means the key of G would be an appropriate key signature. A good example of this is Love One another (308), in the left panel of Figure 3, which shows the distribution of notes in the melody, with the tonic highlighted in blue.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Tonic within ranges (melody lines). Tonics are highlighted in blue.\n\n\nOther melodies also span a full octave but the highest and lowest notes are the tonic itself. A good example of this is All Creatures of Our God and King (62), the right panel of Figure 3. For melodies such as these, a key signature like D (or in this case, Eb) would be more appropriate so that the melody does not go too high or too low.\nSo, it may be the case then that the reason why G major is the most common key is because there are more melodies like Love One another (308) than like All Creatures of Our God and King (62). (Looking through plots like what you see in Figure 3 but for all the hymns in the key of G, it seems like pretty much all of them look similar to Love One another (308).)\nAlong similar lines, if a piece is set to the key of G, the basses get to end the piece on a strong low note that many men, particularly men who sing bass lines, can hit. It’s nice to end a piece with the tonic being the lowest note of the bass line, and the entire hymn. Some examples of these hymns include Do What is Right (237) (shown in Figure 4) and God, Our Father, Hear Us Pray (170). Other hymns, such as those set in C major or Bb major, have the dominant (or fifth note of the scale) as the lowest note of the bass line, sometimes near the very end of the piece, like in Silent Night (203) (shown in Figure 4) or The Spirit of God (2). While dropping down to a low dominant (in this case F if it’s in the key of Bb) can be a nice way to close a piece, I think a stronger finish is to end with the lowest note being the dominant, hence the greater number of hymns set in the key of G.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Tonic within ranges (bass lines). Tonics are highlighted in blue."

    "text": "What about minor keys?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nExactly five hymns are set in a minor key.\n\n\nYou can see the five hymns in a minor key in Figure 5. The most common is, perhaps unsurprisingly, If You Could Hie to Kolob (284) although it’s not especially frequent and is only sung about once every two and a half years or so. Next is the New Year’s Day hymn, Ring Out, Wild Bells (215). We’ll talk more about holidays later on, but it’s only sung by 39% of wards around New Year’s Day. A distant third is That Easter Morn (198) which, from my intuition, is punching above its weight because only 16% of wards sing it around Easter. The last two, Lord, We Come Before Thee Now (162) and How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True? (126)  are pretty unusual and are sung about once every 13 years and once every 60 years or so, respectively.Although, if your ward ever does one of those musical testimony meetings where people get up and say what their favorite hymn is and then everyone sings a verse of that, I suspect you’re pretty much guaranteed to sing it then.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Hymns set in a minor key\n\n\nSo, if you sing a hymn in a minor key, it’s probably one of the two holiday ones or If You Could Hie to Kolob (284). I can’t help but think that the reason If You Could Hie to Kolob (284) is so popular is because it’s set in a minor key. It’s a pretty obscure piece of doctrine that it’s talking about and I wonder if it were set to a different tune if it’d be as popular. In other words, do people like it because of the words or because of the music? Also, for what it’s worth, the distribution of notes looks very much like Love One another (308) (the left panel in Figure 3)."

    "text": "There are two hymns that stand out as “General Conference hymns”. The first is We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19), which is 3.50 times more likely to be sung within a week of General Conference than all the other weeks of the year combined. The second is Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) and is 2.81 times as likely to be sung within a week of General Conference than any other week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe two most typical General Conference hymns are We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) and Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21).\n\n\nHowever, to be clear, while the hymns are somewhat common, not all wards sing them around General Conference. Generally, We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) is sung about every 37.5 weeks in a ward. But, only 28.7% of wards sing it within a week of General Conference. To put it another way, a ward might do so once every seven General Conferences. The other, Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21), is less common generally and is sung once every 1.74 years, or rather, only 57% of wards will sing it in a given year. Within a week of General Conference, only 17.4% of wards will sing it, or a single ward might do it once every 5.5–6 years. So, singing General Conference hymns is not a terribly common thing.\nWe can take a closer look at the annual trends of these two General Conference hymns. General Conference takes place on the first Sunday of April and October. So, I’ve taken the dates of all the times those two hymns are sung and counted how many weeks they are until or since the nearest General Conference. I then tallied all the data, by hymn and by Conference (April vs. October), and produced the plot shown in Figure 1. General Conference itself is indicated by the dotted blue line. The shaded region is around the time that is seven days or less from General Conference.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Annual trends of General Conference hymns.\n\n\nHere we can see that these two hymns are literally centered around General Conference. In general, We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) (top panels) is the more common hymn. Around the April General Conference, it’s most common the week before, and two weeks after. In the October General Conference, it’s more common he two weeks before and one week after. Since it’s a popular hymn and a stable in LDS hymnody, it’s sung throughout the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief soapbox/rant\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t think We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) should be thought of as a hymn about prophets. Yes, the first two lines are about prophets who guide us in these latter-days. But look at the rest of the lyrics. We thank Thee for the gospel and every blessing and we want to serve Thee. The second verse is about how the Lord will deliver us. The third verse is a bit of a grabbag of topics, but prophets are not mentioned. This is not a hymn about prophets; it’s a prayer of gratitude and praise.\nHowever, it has become the prophets hymn. I mean, look how often it’s sung in General Conference! I think the reason for this is because the first line happens to mention prophets. Although, again, it’s within the context of a prayer of gratitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for the next hymnal\n\n\n\nWe should give this a new title and/or a new first verse. I think it’s appropriately placed in the “restoration” section of the hymnal, but I think it should be moved further from “prophets” subsection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for music chairpeople\n\n\n\nConsider singing this hymn around Thanksgiving to highlight its message as a prayer of gratitude.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) (bottom panels) is less common overall. Around the April General Conference, there’s a slight increase in how often it’s sung, but not as clear of a spike. And I’m not really sure why there is a secondary spike four weeks after. There is a clearer spike after the October General Conference, and is most common two weeks before and one week after.\nIn general, the April spikes are smaller than the October spikes. This is most likely because General Conference competes with Easter in April, so wards are more likely to sing Easter hymns instead. So, around the October General Conference is when you’re most likely to hear these hymns.\nI can glean two interesting things from Figure 1. First, the General Conference “season” appears to start two weeks before and ends two weeks after the conference itself. I could imagine wards assigning speakers topics related to general conference (prophets, revelation, etc) leading up to it, and “what did you learn” or “what was your favorite talk” topics afterwards. Anything beyond that though, and there’s no evidence, at least in the hymns we sing, that General Conference is the focus of sacrament meeting.\nThe second interesting thing I see in Figure 1 is something we’ll see with other holidays too: music chairpeople choose the less popular hymns further from the holiday itself and the more popular ones closer to the holiday. Looking at October, we see that the largest spike in the entire figure is for We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) the week before conference. Meanwhile, Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) actually has a drop during that same week. It seems like music chairpeople don’t want to “waste” a “good” hymn on a less-than-ideal week.\n\n\nNow that we’ve established which hymns are sung and how often they are, let’s zoom into the sacrament meetings themselves. Figure 2 shows that these two hymns are both the most common as opening hymns. Interestingly, We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) is also pretty common as a closing hymn, but Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) is not. I’m not sure why there’s a difference in when these two hymns are sung during sacrament, but it would be intriguing to figure out why.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: When during sacrament meeting are General Conference hymns sung?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStats for nerds :)\n\n\n\n\n\nA \\(\\chi^2\\) test suggests that the different patterns between these two is actually not statistically significant: \\(\\chi^2\\) = 3.712, df = 2, p = 0.156.\n\n\n\nSplitting this plot up by weeks leading up to and following General Conference, we see that the clearest trend overall is to sing We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) as the opening hymn the week before General Conference. Besides that, it’s hard to point out any clear patterns, probably because we’ve stretched the data too thinly. (You can submit your ward’s data here!)\n\n\n\nFigure 3: An even deeper look into when these hymns are sung in sacrament meeting by week\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than two prophet-related hymns in our hymnal, but it turns out that very few of them can be considered “General Conference hymns.” Not only are they rare generally, but also there’s no noticeable increase in frequency around General Conference. Figure 4 shows a plot of all the hymns listed in the Topics index under the heading “Prophets,” in order of how common they are generally.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Annual trends of other prophet-related hymns.\n\n\nAs you can see, there are no appreciable spikes around conference season. The most common, Praise to the Man (27) is most common earlier in the Spring, presumably around the time of the First Vision. In people’s defense, Praise to the Man (27) is about a particular prophet, and doesn’t seem like the most appropriate hymn for General Conference. Come, Sing to the Lord (10) is more about the Restoration. Most of the other hymns are just not very common any time of the year.\nThe surprise for me is how uncommon other hymns that are very clearly prophet-related, that would be no less appropriate than the two more common ones, and that are right near the other two hymns in the hymnal are. We Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (22) is only sung once every 4.79 years per ward, or rather only 20.9% of wards sing it in a given year. There is a slight increase in frequency around General Conference, but, going back to saving the “good” ones for the prime slot, it’s most common two weeks before the October conference and one week after. We Ever Pray for Thee (24) is once every 6.76 years per ward, or in only 14.8% of wards. And God Bless Our Prophet Dear (25) is once every 7.66 years per ward, or in only 13.1% of wards. Both of these have very small spikes around General Conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation to music chairpeople\n\n\n\nUse these prophet-related hymns more, especially if your ward has General Conference–related sacrament meetings around then. We have enough of them to sprinkle throughout the two weeks before and after conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though we have several prophet-related hymns, the two most common are We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) and Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21). While they’re sung throughout the year, they’re most common within two weeks of General Conference, especially as opening hymns. April conferences are less likely to see prophet-related hymns than October conferences because of competition with Easter. Some other prophet-related hymns are very occasionally sung around the General Conference “season.”"

So, around the October General Conference is when you’re most likely to hear these hymns.\nI can glean two interesting things from Figure 1. First, the General Conference “season” appears to start two weeks before and ends two weeks after the conference itself. I could imagine wards assigning speakers topics related to general conference (prophets, revelation, etc) leading up to it, and “what did you learn” or “what was your favorite talk” topics afterwards. Anything beyond that though, and there’s no evidence, at least in the hymns we sing, that General Conference is the focus of sacrament meeting.\nThe second interesting thing I see in Figure 1 is something we’ll see with other holidays too: music chairpeople choose the less popular hymns further from the holiday itself and the more popular ones closer to the holiday. Looking at October, we see that the largest spike in the entire figure is for We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) the week before conference. Meanwhile, Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) actually has a drop during that same week. It seems like music chairpeople don’t want to “waste” a “good” hymn on a less-than-ideal week.\n\n\nNow that we’ve established which hymns are sung and how often they are, let’s zoom into the sacrament meetings themselves. Figure 2 shows that these two hymns are both the most common as opening hymns. Interestingly, We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) is also pretty common as a closing hymn, but Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) is not. I’m not sure why there’s a difference in when these two hymns are sung during sacrament, but it would be intriguing to figure out why.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: When during sacrament meeting are General Conference hymns sung?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStats for nerds :)\n\n\n\n\n\nA \\(\\chi^2\\) test suggests that the different patterns between these two is actually not statistically significant: \\(\\chi^2\\) = 3.712, df = 2, p = 0.156.\n\n\n\nSplitting this plot up by weeks leading up to and following General Conference, we see that the clearest trend overall is to sing We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) as the opening hymn the week before General Conference. Besides that, it’s hard to point out any clear patterns, probably because we’ve stretched the data too thinly. (You can submit your ward’s data here!)\n\n\n\nFigure 3: An even deeper look into when these hymns are sung in sacrament meeting by week\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than two prophet-related hymns in our hymnal, but it turns out that very few of them can be considered “General Conference hymns.” Not only are they rare generally, but also there’s no noticeable increase in frequency around General Conference. Figure 4 shows a plot of all the hymns listed in the Topics index under the heading “Prophets,” in order of how common they are generally.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Annual trends of other prophet-related hymns.\n\n\nAs you can see, there are no appreciable spikes around conference season. The most common, Praise to the Man (27) is most common earlier in the Spring, presumably around the time of the First Vision. In people’s defense, Praise to the Man (27) is about a particular prophet, and doesn’t seem like the most appropriate hymn for General Conference. Come, Sing to the Lord (10) is more about the Restoration. Most of the other hymns are just not very common any time of the year.\nThe surprise for me is how uncommon other hymns that are very clearly prophet-related, that would be no less appropriate than the two more common ones, and that are right near the other two hymns in the hymnal are. We Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (22) is only sung once every 4.79 years per ward, or rather only 20.9% of wards sing it in a given year. There is a slight increase in frequency around General Conference, but, going back to saving the “good” ones for the prime slot, it’s most common two weeks before the October conference and one week after. We Ever Pray for Thee (24) is once every 6.76 years per ward, or in only 14.8% of wards. And God Bless Our Prophet Dear (25) is once every 7.66 years per ward, or in only 13.1% of wards. Both of these have very small spikes around General Conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation to music chairpeople\n\n\n\nUse these prophet-related hymns more, especially if your ward has General Conference–related sacrament meetings around then. We have enough of them to sprinkle throughout the two weeks before and after conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though we have several prophet-related hymns, the two most common are We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) and Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21). While they’re sung throughout the year, they’re most common within two weeks of General Conference, especially as opening hymns. April conferences are less likely to see prophet-related hymns than October conferences because of competition with Easter. Some other prophet-related hymns are very occasionally sung around the General Conference “season.”"

As far as I can tell, §19.3.2 of the General Handbook has the only instruction about sacrament hymns, and it says that “[t]he sacrament hymn should refer to the sacrament itself or to the sacrifice of the Savior.” This instruction is repeated on page 380 of the hymnal.\nAs it turns out, I Stand All Amazed (193), which is the most common hymn overall, is part of that group. So it should come as no surprise that a sacrament hymn is the most common hymn overall. That one in particular focuses less on the sacrament itself and more on the Atonement, so it could be used outside of sacrament contexts without feeling out of place. In fact, a quick look at the numbers suggests that it was, in fact, sung as opening and closing hymns at least three times more often than any other sacrament hymn. This may explain why it stands out as the most commonly sung hymn in sacrament meetings."

    "text": "Frequency\nLet’s take a closer look at the sacrament hymns themselves. In theory, if a ward were to systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns, they’d make it through all of them in a little over six months. However, Figure 1 shows that they’re definitely not all sung equally as often as each other.\nMost plots on this page are formatted just like this one here. Hymns that are less common are in the lower left and hymns that are more common are in the upper right. The numbers along the bottom refer to how many times, on average, a ward will sing that hymn within a given year.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sacrament hymns in order of frequency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining I Stand All Amazed (193) as the most common ones are In Humility, Our Savior (172), There is a Green Hill Far Away (194), and Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (196). Each one of these is sung around two or three times per year, on average, or once every four to five months.\nMost sacrament hymns are sung at least once a year per ward, on average, but there were some that were less common. O Lord of Hosts (178), Again, Our Dear Redeeming Lord (179), and Again, We Meet around the Board (186) each averaged somewhere between once every 13 and 17 months. The least frequent sacrament hymn though was O Thou, Before the World Began (189), showing up about once every two years.\nAlso, keep in mind that some wards in this dataset do in fact systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns. I recalculated the numbers without those wards (Figure 2), and the common hymns were slightly more frequent and the uncommon ones were even rarer. For example, O Thou, Before the World Began (189) jumped down from once every two years to once every three years.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them"

    "text": "Non-sacrament hymns\nOnce in a while, a ward will indeed sing some other hymn as a sacrament hymn. Many hymns were selected by at least one ward at least one time, but two stood out. They are O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197) and Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) (Figure 3). There is good reason for why these two were sung as sacrament hymns: if you look up “Sacrament” in the topical index in the back of the hymnal, it is a list of all the hymns from 169–196, but it also includes these two.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them\n\n\nLet’s start with O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197). It was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every four years per ward on average. Given that it feels like a sacrament hymn and like an Easter hymn, it is perfectly placed between the more on-the-nose sacrament hymns (i.e. those about the bread and water) and the more traditional Easter hymns (e.g. He is Risen! (199)). Perhaps some music chairpeople noticed it in the Index and chose it because of that. But, I could see a music chairperson selecting it because they perhaps thought sacrament hymns went from 169–197 instead of 169–196.\nThe oddball though is Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146). In fact, it was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every two years per ward, which is just about as often as O Thou, Before the World Began (189). It is not clear to me why this one is listed in the index as a sacrament hymn, but it’s not grouped together with the other sacrament hymns. The “Prayer and Supplication” category of hymns, which is what this is a part of (and rightfully so, in my opinion), is just before the “Sacrament” category. If it, like O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197), fits into both categories, then I think it should be moved to hymn 168 so that it’s less out of left field. This one really should be thought of as an honorary sacrament hymn. Perhaps we’ll see it included in the “official” list of sacrament hymns in the next hymnal."

Unsurprisingly, I Stand All Amazed (193) is at the top, being sung occasionally as an opening hymn and closing hymn. At only once every 6–7 years, it’s not particularly common to see it sung this way, but it’s still not unheard of. After that, there are a few others like Behold the Great Redeemer Die (191) and There Is a Green Hill Far Away (194) were also used as one of the other hymns, but it was still quite unusual.\nOverall, while singing a specific sacrament hymn elsewhere in the meeting is pretty unusual, the odds of singing any of the sacrament hymns is more common since their frequencies add together. It happened in 61 of the 5211 sacrament meetings I have data from, or 1.1% of them. That means, on average, a ward might since hymn 169–196 at some other point in the meeting approximately once every year and ten months."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe findings in this section suggest that were have a strong tradition of singing hymns 169 through 196 in our sacrament meetings immediately before the sacrament itself. Some wards systematically cycle through them, which I believe is a perfectly appropriate thing to do to include the widest variety of hymns to the ward. Other wards pick and choose, which inevitably leads to some favorites being sung more and some lesser-known ones falling through the cracks.\nAs we’ll see when we look at holidays, wards do not always stick to the table of contents at the beginning of the hymnal when choosing appropriate hymns. However, in the case of the sacrament—which is the most important part of our Sunday worship and the primary reason for Sunday gatherings—it’s clear that we adhere strongly to the recommendation. Nevertheless, the addition of Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) shows that there is at least some room for thinking out of the box when selecting sacrament hymns."

I don’t think these hymns are intended to be sung as congregational hymns in sacrament meeting and with a few exceptions, I don’t think they’re sung much at all. Let’s look a little closer at these arrangements."

    "title": "Does anyone sing the women’s and men’s arrangements?",
    "section": "Types of Women’s and Men’s arrangements",
    "text": "Types of Women’s and Men’s arrangements\nWe can classify these hymns into a few different categories. First, we can group them based on the type of musical arrangement. Some of the hymns, like A Key Was Turned in Latter Days (310) or Come, All Ye Sons of God (322), look like most other hymns because they’re arranged in a normal SATB format with four voices throughout. Two of the women’s hymns, As Sisters in Zion (309) and We Meet Again As Sisters (311), look a little more like primary songs since the left hand is simplified, which makes sense because it would be somewhat strange to hear men singing either of those two. Similarly, the men’s hymn, The Priesthood of Our Lord (320) does not have full harmony lines written and appears that it is intended to be sung in unison. These two types of arrangements are both labeled “Women” or “Men” in the hymnal.\nThe other main type of musical arrangement is where it a special arrangement geared towards the voices of the gender they are for. For the women, this means it’s a SSA arrangement, with the alto on a separate staff as in Love At Home (318). The piano gets its own lines, meaning the hymn has a total of four staves, which is potentially confusing for some people at first glance. The men get TTBB arrangements, as in Oh Say, What Is Truth? (331). These are written with a tenor clef centered around C, which is essentially a treble clef but down an octave, which is intimidating at first glance and sometimes tricky to play on the piano. We could even further subdivide the men’s arrangements based on which tenor part has the melody. In most of these arrangements, the highest part has the melody, as in Come, Come Ye Saints (326). For three of them though, the highest singer gets a harmony line and the melody is below that, as in Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335). The women’s hymn The Lord is My Shepherd (316) and the men’s hymn School Thy Feelings (336) does a mix of these two, and the melody switches from one part to another. All of these special arrangements are labeled “Women’s Choir” or “Men’s Choir”.\nThe other way of classifying these 29 hymns is whether the hymn appears elsewhere in the hymnal or not. This classification is pretty closely correlated with the musical arrangement as well. For example, among the 10 women’s hymns, three are unique to women and don’t appear anywhere else in the hymnal; these three are also the ones arranged in a SATB-like format. The other seven women’s hymns are special arrangements of hymns that occur earlier in the hymnal in a SATB format.\nFor the men’s hymns, the correlation is not quite so tight. Of the six men’s hymns that are not full TTBB arrangements, four do not occur elsewhere in the hymnal. The last is Rise Up, O Men of God (324), which has a unique melody but the same lyrics as the TTBB arrangement, Rise Up, O Men of God (323), on the previous page. Of the 14 Men’s Choir arrangements, five are unique and don’t occur elsewhere in the hymnal (like See, the Mighty Angel Flying (330)), while the rest are arrangements of existing hymns, like Come, Come Ye Saints (326), including some pretty infrequently sung hymns, like Thy Servants Are Prepared (261). Then of course, Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (336) has unique lyrics, but the music is the same as Should You Feel Inclined to Censure (325).\nA summary of all these classifications can be found in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n\nTable 1: Women’s Hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nHymn Name\nArrangement type\nFound elsewhere?\nSung in Sacrament?\n\n\n\n\n309\nAs Sisters in Zion\nTwo-Part\nUnique\nyes\n\n\n310\nA Key Was Turned in Latter Days\nTwo-Part\nUnique\nno\n\n\n311\nWe Meet Again As Sisters\nTwo-Part\nUnique\nno\n\n\n312\nWe Ever Pray for Thee\nSSA\nHymn 23\nno\n\n\n313\nGod is Love\nSSA\nHymn 87\nno\n\n\n314\nHow Gentle God’s Commands\nSSA\nHymn 125\nno\n\n\n315\nJesus, the Very Thought of Thee\nSSA\nHymn 141\nno\n\n\n316\nThe Lord is My Shepherd\nSSA\nHymn 108\nno\n\n\n317\nSweet is the Work\nSSA\nHymn 147\nno\n\n\n318\nLove at Home\nSSA\nHymn 294\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Men’s Hymns.

Next was Ye Elders of Israel (319), which was sung 10 times in my sample. The others were only sung once or twice. Musically, the hymns Come, All Ye Sons of God (322) and Rise Up, O Men of God (324) are like Ye Elders of Israel (319) and would be less awkward to sing in church because their arrangements are perfectly fine as SATB and wouldn’t throw off the organist or the congregants. But, it would be very strange to sing See the Mighty Priesthood Gathered (325) and Go, Ye Messengers of Heaven (327) because either the melody is in the “alto” line, like Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335), or the melody is too high for a typical member to sing since it is arranged for a high tenor."

    "text": "My recommendations for the next hymnal\nTo summarize, very few of the women’s and men’s arrangements are sung in sacrament meeting, and those that are are rarely done so. Based on this data, I believe these hymns should probably just be removed from the hymnal. There is little reason to print tens of thousands of these 29 hymns that hardly anyone uses. As mentioned above, the previous version of the hymnal had more arrangements—some of which were full-on choir pieces—and they were removed in this 1985 edition. It makes sense to continue that trend. We don’t need to remove them completely though—I think they should be part of an online-only supplement that would be accessible through the church’s apps and website.\nIt may be the case that these hymns were kept in the hymnal with the intention of them being sung in Relief Society and Elders Quorum meetings. But now that we do not begin those meetings with hymns anymore, there is little reason to keep them. Maybe there is value in singing one of these hymns in some stake priesthood meeting or a women’s session of General Conference, and if the hymnal is treated as “canon” for what can or cannot be sung in church meetings, then it might be worth it to keep some in there simply to hold their place as canon. In my opinion though, an online supplement can serve that purpose.\nSome of these hymns can and probably should be repurposed and brought into the main collection of hymns. For example, Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335) appears to be the most common of these 29 hymns and it would be a shame to lose it. But, there is no reason to keep it as a men’s-only arrangement: simply rearrange it as an SATB piece and I suspect it could become a more popular one."

    "text": "The most common hymns\nThe most common hymns sung in the church, according to my data, are displayed in Figure 1. Here, sacrament hymns are in gray and other hymns are in black. I’ve shown only the hymns that are sung, on average, one or more times per year per ward. Since I’ve already posted about the sacrament hymns, I’ll focus now on just the non-sacrament hymns.You may think that a lot of hymns that pertain to specific holidays would make it onto this list, but as we’ll see in later blog posts about annual trends, there are actually relatively few festive hymns that are sung by most wards most years.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The “favorites”: Hymns that are sung at least once per year\n\n\nThis figure shows nice list of 22 hymns that are probably well-known by most members of the church, like I Know That My Redeemer Lives (136), How Firm a Foundation (85), and Because I Have Been Given Much (219). They are generic enough to be appropriate for most meetings. Their message is centered on Christ and other foundational tenents of our religion. Some are more common around certain holidays, like Come, Come Ye Saints (30) around Pioneer Day in Utah or Love At Home (294) around Mother’s Day, but they’re also general enough to be appropriate at other times of the year as well. Thus, what we see in Figure 1 is a solid list of the most popular hymns in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nFigure 1 also shows how common each of these hymns are. I Know That My Redeemer Lives (136) was sung, on average, 1.72 times per year per ward, or about once every seven months. How Firm a Foundation (85) and Because I Have Been Given Much (219) were about once every 7–8 months. Lord, I Would Follow Thee (220), I Believe in Christ (134), and High on the Mountain Top (5) were once every 8–9 months. We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19), Now Let Us Rejoice (3), Love at Home (294), and Teach Me to Walk in the Light (304) were once every 9–10 months. The rest were less than once every 10 months but still at least once a year. Of course, your ward may sing these more or less often than what is shown here, but this is the average across all the wards I have data from.\nTo contrast this, some sacrament hymns are sung, on average, more than twice a year. Keep in mind that there are only 48 sacrament meetings per year, and 28 sacrament hymns to choose from, so many will have to double up. None of the non-sacrament hymns were sung, on average, more than twice a year.\nThis list of favorites is useful because if you are a new ward organist, these are the hymns to practice first. Learning these 22 hymns (plus the sacrament hymns) will get you the most mileage. In fact, these 46 hymns account for 43% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting in this sample. That means that if you learn the hymns shown in Figure 1, you’ll be able to play almost half of the meetings in your ward.\n\nAre these the “standards”?\nIt is interesting to compare this list of the most popular hymns, which I’m calling the “favorites,” to the list in the back of the hymnal under the section “Hymns for Stake Conference” (page 381). That section lists “standard, well-known hymns” and it is implied that many members would have these hymns memorized. Interestingly, there is not a lot of overlap between these lists. Figure 2 shows which hymns appear in Figure 1 and are usually sung more than once a year (excluding sacrament hymns), and which are the “standards” listed in the back of the hymnal. This time, the hymns in purple are ones that are recommended as “standards” and are indeed sung pretty regularly. The blue ones are what are sung pretty often but are not one of “the standards” listed in the back of the hymnal. The red ones are recommended “standards” that are not as popular. Most of lesser-popular “standards” are still sung pretty regularly, usually at least once every two years. The exception is Come, O Thou King of Kings (59), which is sung less than once every two years and is not what I would consider to be a popular hymn.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Standard vs. Popular hymns. Here, “standard” means they’re recommended in the back of the hymnal as a well-known hymn. “Popular” means they’re sung more than once a year according to this sample. Sacrament hymns are excluded.\n\n\nHowever, it should be kept in mind that this isn’t exactly a fair comparison. For one, this list of “standards” is what is recommended for stake conference, which is not the same as sacrament meeting. Also, this list printed in the back of the hymnal is presumably what was recommended in 1985 when this hymnal was first published. What is considered a standard has surely changed in the past few decades. Furthermore, many of the currently most popular hymns were new additions to the 1985 hymnal, including Because I Have Been Given Much (219), I Believe in Christ (134), I Am a Child of God (301), and Called to Serve (249). It makes sense that they’re not recommended in the back of the hymnal because they were brand new when that list was published! How could they have know they’d be so popular? My recommendation for the church would be to update the list of stake conference recommendations to include these most popular hymns and to remove the ones that are less common today."

    "text": "Click below depending on how much data you have to contribute.\n\nSubmit many weeks’ worth of dataSubmit one week’s worth of data\n\n\nHere are the best ways you can help out:\n\nSomeone in your ward likely keeps a spreadsheet that has the past few weeks/months/years of hymns sung in sacrament meeting in your ward. This is typically shared between the music chairperson, chorister(s), organist(s), and a bishopric member. If you or someone close to you has access to that spreadsheet, you can simply send a copy to me. This is probably the best way to contribute to this project.\nIf you have a collection of old sacrament meeting programs from your ward, either digital or physical, those usually list the hymns that were sung that week. (I know hardly anyone carries physical scriptures anymore, but look through those to see if there are any old ones tucked away in there!) You can either write down the information from those programs onto a new spreadsheet or document and send me that, or just send me copies of the programs themselves.\nReturn to this page and submit the form every week.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if the sacrament meeting info you send me is recent or not. One ward sent me information from 2003! It also doesn’t matter if there are gaps in your contribution. So if you have data from 2018 and then more from 2023 but missed the years in between, that’s totally fine!\nIf you contribute at least year’s worth of sacrament meetings, I’ll be able to run some stats on your ward, like how varied your hymns are or how unusual they are, compared to other wards. But, any amount of data helps—even if it’s just from a single week or two!\nAgain, email whatever contributions you have to hymnstats@gmail.com and I’ll incorporate it into the analysis as quickly as I can!"

    "text": "Welcome to the LDS Hymn Stats project! The purpose of this project is to discover what hymns are most commonly sung generally and in certain times of the year in sacrament meetings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have gathered information on what hymns were sung in 6122 sacrament meetings from 250 wards. This site gives some of the more important findings; I am writing a short book that contains more detailed results."

    "text": "Project Overview\nHave you ever wondered what the most common hymn is in sacrament meeting? I can tell you right now: it’s I Stand All Amazed (193) and it’s sung, on average, once every four and a half months in a given ward. What hymn is least common? Well, that’s a trickier question to answer, but if you ignore the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal, some of the least common hymns in sacrament meeting are Sons of Michael, He Approaches (51), This House We Dedicate to Thee (245), Go, Ye Messengers of Glory (262), and God Save the King (341).\nWhat is the most popular Christmas hymn? It looks like it’s Joy to the World (201). If that matches your intuition, then that’s good news because it’s means I’ve got good data! But, what is the most popular Mother’s Day hymn? Thanksgiving? Valentine’s Day?\nWith this project, I have been able to answer some of these simpler questions, but I’ve also been able to uncover some subtler patterns as well. Like, what Christmas hymns are typically sung the third Sunday in December? (The First Noel (213) might be the most likely.) On the Sunday after Thanksgiving (in the United States), do people sing more Thanksgiving hymns, Christmas hymns, or neither? Are there “unofficial” sacrament hymns that are sung more than any of the “official” ones? What percentage of wards outside of Utah (but still in the US) sing Pioneer Day hymns around Pioneer Day?\nI’ve also uncovered some of what might go through a music chairperson’s head as they select what hymns are to be sung in their ward. It seems like the more popular Christmas hymns are reserved for Sundays when it is anticipated that the most number of people will be in attendance, and the less popular ones are used during peak travel dates. Even though the entry for “Thanksgiving” in topic index in the back of the hymnal directs readers to the “Gratitude” for more hymns, very few people actually use those gratitude-themed hymns around Thanksgiving. Easter hymns trump both General Conference– and Fast Sunday–themed hymns in April, and Fourth of July trumps Fast Sunday hymns.\nFurthermore, I’ve been able to uncover patterns that say something interesting about Mormon culture. For example, Mother’s Day hymns are typically about earthly mothers while Father’s Day hymns are about Heavenly Father. Enough Utahns have relocated to other parts of the US that Pioneer Day may be considered a de facto LDS holiday. And a decent number of wards systematically cycle through the 28 sacrament hymns, sometimes for years without any deviation.\nAs a secondary part of this project, I’m also addressing questions about the music of the hymns. What hymn has the highest melody note? Well, if you exclude the women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal and the optional note at the end of Carry On (255), it’s the F# in the rarely-sung Lean on My Ample Arm (120). What part has the narrowest range? What is the most common key signature? How many hymns could you sing the tenor line for if you can only go up to a Bb? What is the most common final chord? How many hymns don’t end on “do”? How many add9 chords are there in the hymnal?"

    "text": "My name is Joey Stanley and I’ve been working on this project since 2013. It started with one simple question: “What is the most common hymn?” Initially, I sought to answer this question by collecting a year’s worth of data from 1000 wards across the country. A pipe dream if there ever was one. But I have been able to get enough data to the point where I believe I’ve hit a critical mass. It’s more than a lifetime’s worth of sacrament meetings for any one person (even if you attend multiple sacrament meetings for a few decades), and enough to uncover some pretty subtle patterns.\nI am a linguistics professor at BYU, which means I am not a statistician or musicologist, though I do have some training in both statistics and music. What qualifies me for this project are my skills in data analysis and vizualization, as well as my sheer interest in the project.\nI’m motivated to complete this project soon because the church will soon release a new hymnal, at which point all of my data will be obsolete. I hope that I can get these results out there so that people can use it help them with their callings, so the church can use it when designing the new hymnal, and to provide a snapshot of hymn usage data before the 1985 hymnal is phased out.\nIf you would like to contribute to the project, please see the contribute tab above."
