    "text": "In the United States, the Sunday after Thanksgiving is a weird one. We’re just getting off a holiday and even though a few days have passed, a lot of people haven’t returned to work or school yet. You may still have family over on that Sunday, or you yourself may still be traveling. There is definitely a lingering Thanksgiving effect going on. But at the same time, Christmas is coming up. Many people have already decorated their houses and put up Christmas trees. Even if you refuse to listen to Christmas music before Thanksgiving, all the pent up pressure finally bursts after Thanksgiving and we enter the Christmas season with full force.\nSo, how does that translate into hymns in sacrament meeting? Do people continue to sing Thanksgiving hymns or do they sing Christmas hymns? Let’s dive into that Sunday after Thanksgiving and see what happens in the 361 relevant sacrament meetings I have data from."

I’ve color-coded the hymn names to correspond to the holiday they are most closely associated with. Hymns 201–214 are Christmas hymns and are colored in red. Hymns 91–95, Count Your Blessings (#241), Because I Have Been Given Much (#219), and All Creatures of Our God and King (#62) are Thanksgiving hymns and are colored in blue. Everything else is colored in gray.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Most popular congregational hymns the Sunday after Thanksgiving\n\n\n\n\nIt’s apparent that the Sunday after Thanksgiving is heavy on both Thanksgiving and Christmas hymns. Over 15% of wards sing either Prayer of Thanksgiving (#93), Come, Ye Thankful People (#94), or For the Beauty of the Earth (#92). The most popular Christmas hymn during this week is Joy to the World (#201), but only about 7.5% of wards sing it the Sunday after Thanksgiving. What I like about this plot is that there’s a nice mix of Thanksgiving and Christmas hymns. So, is that Sunday a Thanksgiving week or a Christmas week? It really depends on the ward!

    "text": "Thanksgiving vs. Christmas\nTable 1 shows the percentage of wards in my sample that sing Thanksgiving and Christmas hymns the week after Thanksgiving. The top right cell shows that 24.4% of wards sing at least one Christmas hymn and no Thanksgiving hymns. The bottom left cell shows that 41.0% of wards sing at least one Thanksgiving hymn and no Christmas hymns. So, in my opinion, combining what is seen in Figure 1 with Table 1, it’s pretty clear that the Sunday after Thanksgiving is more often thought of as a Thanksgving week, rather than a Christmas week when it comes to the hymns. Almost twice the number of wards do it that way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Percentage of wards that sing Thanksgiving and Christmas hymns the\nSunday after Thanksgiving \n  \n    \n    \n      Christmas hymns\n      \n        Thanksgiving hymns\n      \n    \n    \n      yes\n      no\n    \n  \n  \n    yes\n7.2%\n24.4%\n    no\n41.0%\n27.4%\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe surprising numbers are the other two in Table 1. 27.4% of wards don’t sing any holiday hymns the week after Thanksgiving. That’s more than the number of wards that sing Christmas hymns! My guess is that they see that the Thanksgiving “season” is over and the Christmas season hasn’t started yet, so it’s a bit of a no man’s land in the middle. There doesn’t appear to be any sort of pattern to the hymns that are sung by these wards. The ones that are slightly more common are among the more common hymns overall, so it seems like music coordinators just treat it as a neutral week and pick whatever hymns they’d pick during any other non-holiday week.\nThe other surprising number is that 7.2% of wards sing both a Thanksgiving and a Christmas hymn! It’s a rare case of two different holidays being celebrated through song in the same meeting. As far as what hymns are sung, we’ve seen already that the most canonical Thanksgiving hymns are most common the Sunday before Thanksgiving, which means the less popular ones are slightly more popular two weeks before or the week after. (We’ll look at Christmas hymns in a later blog post.)\nThere does seem to be a pattern though for when within the meeting these Thanksgiving and Christmas hymns are sung. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most common configuration is for the opening hymn to be a Thanksgiving hymn and the closing hymn to be a Christmas hymn and, if there is an intermediate hymn, it’s neither a Thanksgiving nor Christmas hymn. This is what was found in over half the cases. However, pretty much every other configuration is attested in this small sample of 26 sacrament meetings that sing at least one Thanksgiving hymn and one Christmas hymn the week after Thanksgiving, as seen in Table 2. (Note here that “Other” means any hymn that is not a Christmas or Thanksgiving hymn.)\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Configurations of Thanksgiving and Christmas hymns among wards that sing both the Sunday after Thanksgiving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening\nSacrament\nIntermediate\nClosing\nnumber of wards\npercent of wards\n\n\n\n\nThanksgiving\nOther\nNone/Other\nChristmas\n15\n57.7%\n\n\nThanksgiving\nOther\nThanksgiving\nChristmas\n4\n15.4%\n\n\nChristmas\nOther\nThanksgiving\nChristmas\n2\n7.7%\n\n\nOther\nOther\nThanksgiving\nChristmas\n2\n7.7%\n\n\nThanksgiving\nOther\nChristmas\nChristmas\n2\n7.7%\n\n\nChristmas\nOther\nNone/Other\nThanksgiving\n1\n3.8%"

    "text": "December 1st\nTo me, what is perhaps the most interesting thing about the Sunday after Thanksgiving is to see what kind of effect the actual date has on the hymns. Most of the time, that Sunday is still in November (it can be as early as November 25th). But, occasionally, it can be as late as December 1st. How noticeable is that boundary between the two months when it comes to hymns?\nAs it turns out, pretty noticeable! Figure 2 shows the breakdown of Thanksgiving, Christmas, and other hymns the Sunday after Thanksgiving by date. As you can see, there is a tendency to sing fewer Thanksgiving hymns the further into the month of November that Sunday is. It’s not super clear whether there’s the same trend for Christmas hymns within November, but there is an obvious increase in the number of Christmas hymns being sung if that Sunday after Thanksgiving is December 1st. There are 2–3 times as many Christmas hymns sung on December first than any last Sunday in November.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proportion of Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Other hymns by date\n\n\n\n\nTo dig just a little deeper, I wanted to see the trends for specific hymns across these dates. In Figure 3 (sorry for the small text), each of the eight Thanksgiving hymns and 14 Christmas hymns is in their own panel. Lines and dots are higher if that hymn is sung more often on that day. Among the Thanksgiving hymns, the most apparent trend is that Come, Ye Thankful People, Come (#94) is less and less common the later in the month.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Thanksgiving and Christmas song frequencies, Nov 25 through Dec 1\n\n\n\n\nAmong the Christmas hymns though, there are two hymns that clearly stand out. Joy to the World (#201) and Oh, Come, All Ye Faithful (#202) have a huge spike on December 1st! Those two hymns each make up over 15% of all the hymns sung on December 1st, but less than 3% on November 30th or almost any other day in November. And keep in mind, everything in this plot is from the Sunday after Thanksgiving, so it’s not like we’re seeing an increase a week or two after Thanksgiving.\nI should mention that Figure 2 and Figure 3 are only possible because I have data spanning over 20 years. Since the Sunday after Thanksgiving falls on different days, I can compare those days to each other. So, for example, in 2023, the Sunday after Thanksgiving is November 26th. But the Sunday after Thanksgiving was also November 26th in 2006 and 2017, so that column represents those three years pooled together. I think this is important to mention because no matter how much data is collected from one year, you’ll still only see just one of these columns. It takes a lot of data over many years to be able to see this kind of nuance.\nBy the way, I wanted to see if there were more Christmas hymns sung the Sunday after Thanksgiving in more recent years compared to, say, 20 years ago. I hypothesized that as American culture (or at least businesses) are more and more accepting of the Christmas season starting sooner, that might get reflected in the hymns. Turns out, I didn’t see any obvious trend. But, it’s difficult to tease apart the date (November 25 through December 1) from the year (2002 through 2023) when the data is spread too thinly like this. I’d probably need a lot more data across the past 20 years to be able to say with more confidence whether this is true or not."

If we do a breakdown by date though, we see that if the Sunday after Thanksgiving is December 1st, we see more Christmas hymns. Specifically, we see that that is driven almost entirely by Joy to the World (#201) and Oh, Come, All Ye Faithful (#202)."

By this, I mean that, if a hymn is in the key of G major, are there hymns that do not end on a G? As it turns out, there are 16 of them!\nTwelve of these 16 hymns end on the third of the chord. The most common is Thy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188), which is a sacrament hymn, albeit one of the lesser common ones. Most of the others are not unusual and they include ones like The First Noel (#298), Secret Prayer (#225), and Master, the Tempest Is Raging (#105).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First Noel (#213)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimony (#137)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Know My Father Lives (#302)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecret Prayer (#144)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod Speed the Right (#106)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (#197)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster, the Tempest Is Raging (#105)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, May My Soul Commune with Thee (123)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Ever Pray for Thee (#23)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLean on My Ample Arm (#120)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Ever Pray for Thee (312)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other four hymns end on the fifth of the chord. We get another sacrament hymn, While of These Emblems We Partake (#173), as well as Carry On (#255), Does the Journey Seem Long? (#127), and Now the Day Is Over (#159).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile of These Emblems We Partake (#173)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarry On (#255)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the Journey Seem Long? (#127)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the Day Is Over (#159)\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, overall, relatively few hymns end on the third or the fifth of the chord, just 4.6% of the hymnal. But, because a few sacrament hymns are on this list, as well as several relatively well-known hymns, it’s not a terribly unusual thing to see. In fact, you’re likely to see one of these 16 hymns about once every six weeks or so."

The following figure shows how many hymns end on which note of the scale, with each part on its own plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should come as no surprise that every single bass line ends on the tonic. What is more interesting is the two middle parts. The alto line is nearly evenly split between ending on the tonic, the third note of the scale, or the fifth note of the scale, with a very slight preference for the root. Meanwhile, the tenor line ends on the third 64% of the time, and is otherwise evenly split between the root and the fifth. I’m not quite sure what anyone might do with this information, but it’s interesting to see nonetheless!\nOverall, if you were to sing all four parts of all the hymns (again, excluding the men’s and women’s arrangements at the back), you’ll end on the tonic 62.7% of the time, the third 25.0% of the time, and the fifth just 12.3% of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for the next hymnal\n\n\n\nAdd fifths to more final chords."

In some hymns, at least one part sustains its last note while at least one other part resolves a chord or moves in some other way. There are eight hymns that do this.\nTwo of these hymns, He Died! The Great Redeemer Died (#192) and As the Shadows Fall (#168) end with a Sus4 chord resolving to the tonic chord, with the tenor line responsible for the resolution. The latter of those two has a fifth in the chord, creating some nice close harmony between the tenor and alto line, while the former lacks the fifth and has a more open sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe Died! The Great Redeemer Died (#192)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Shadows Fall (#168)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother type of movement we see is when the four parts land on a tonic chord, but then the tenors and altos move to the subdominant and then back to the tonic. In Keep the Commandments (#303), the two inner lines move down and then back up to return to the original notes. In Behold! A Royal Army (#251), they both jump up a fourth and then back down a second, creating a different voicing of the tonic chord than what they started on. In the case of Come unto Jesus (#117), the alto line has a little passing tone.I don’t know enough about music theory to say for sure of the penultimate chord in Keep the Commandments (#303) is a subdominant or something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep the Commandments (#303)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehold!

In Let Us All Press On (#243), the alto and tenor finish their final phrase. And in How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True? (#126) has a unique chord progression with some nice tension resolution.Again, I don’t know enough about music theory to say what is going on here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet Us All Press On (#243)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Long, O Lord Most Holy and True?

Overall, you’ll see one of these hymns about once every 11 weeks or so."

    "title": "What are the most common final chords?",
    "section": "Final chords",
    "text": "Final chords\nWe now turn to the topic of the final chords themselves, rather than individual parts or notes. As established already, all hymns end in a major or minor chord, so the only options are roots, thirds, and fifths of chords. Logically, there are \\(3\\times 3\\times 3\\times 3=81\\) possible ways to use those three notes, if you ignore octave differences and good musical taste. Of course, the hymnal uses far fewer than that.Since two of the five hymns set in a minor key end in picardy thirds, there are only two hymns that truly end in a minor chord.\nLet me pause briefly to explain the notation I’ll be using. I’ll describe the voicing of the chord using the numbers 1, 3, or 5, from lowest (bass) to highest (soprano). So if we’re in the key of C major, 1-5-3-1 would mean the basses are on a C3, the tenors a G3 above that, the altos on an E4 above that, and the sopranos on a C5 above that. If a part sings in unison with the part below it, I replace its number with an asterisk. This figure shows the twelve configurations found in the hymnal, in order of frequency. Let’s dive into each one of these.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-3-1-* endings\nThe most common voicings to end a hymn on is 1-3-1-*. The bass line ends on the tonic, the tenor a third above, and the alto and soprano lines in unison on the root of the chord (an octave higher). The most common non-sacrament hymn to end on this voicing is Lord, I Would Follow Thee (#220), shown below.\n\n\n\nLord, I Would Follow Thee (#220)\n\n\nAlmost all the hymns that fit this 1-3-1-* description look just like Lord, I Would Follow Thee (#220), but two hymns are slightly different in that the bass note is down an octave. We get this in O My Father (#292) and The Voice of God Again Is Heard (#18).\n\n\n\nO My Father (#292)\n\n\nBecause there are 97 hymns that are voiced as 1-3-1-*, I’m not going to show all of them, but here is a plot that shows the most common ones and how often they are sung in a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we just look at the key signatures of the hymns that fall into this category, we get pretty much all of them. But when we arrange those key signatures in order, we see a pretty clear pattern. Basically, the key of D major is the ideal key to end with this chord, and the closer a key signature is to D, the more likely it is to also use this chord. For keys further away, you’re less likely to see this voicing. For whatever reason, it’s just not ideal to have a hymn in the key of G end with this voicing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lowest version of this voicing are the two hymns in the key of B♭ major, Silent Night (#204) and Joseph Smith’s First Prayer (#26) which are the lowest final notes for the soprano line and as mentioned already are among the lowest soprano notes in the hymnal. Meanwhile, the highest instance is in A♭ in The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37), making that A♭3 the highest note the alto line ends on and the A♭4 the highest final bass note (which probably explains the optional lower note).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Smith’s First Prayer (#26)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilent Night (#204)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow often are you likely to see this voicing? Well, since there are 97 hymns that fit this category, including many sacrament hymns, pretty likely. Based on the 17,833 sacrament meetings I have data from, 33.0% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting use this voicing, which means odds are pretty good that on any given Sunday, you’ll see at least one hymn ending in 1-3-1-*.\n\n\n1-3-5-1 endings\nThe 1-3-5-1 ending is basically tied for first place as the most common ending. In its most basic form, it’s a triad with the tonic repeated on top. 96 hymns end with this voicing. One of the most common non-sacrament ones is High on the Mountain Top (#5).\n\n\n\nHigh on the Mountain Top (#5)\n\n\n83 hymns look just like High on the Mountain Top (#5) above. But, like what we saw with 1-3-1-*, there is a subtype where the bass note is down an octave, creating a large interval between the bass and tenor notes. A common one is How Firm a Foundation (#85), which you can see below. Besides this one, there are another 14 hymns with this configuration.\n\n\n\nHow Firm a Foundation (#85)\n\n\nAgain, there are too many hymns that are 1-3-5-1, so I won’t show all of them. But here are plots that show the most common ones and how often they are sung in a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we just look at the key signatures of the hymns that fall into this category, we get 1-3-5-1 endings in most keys. While the 1-3-1-* voicing above appeared to be centered around D major, this one appears to be more common in slightly higher keys. The reason is likely the alto voice: anything lower would put it pretty low. In fact, the one instance in D♭ is in As the Shadows Fall (#168), which makes that A♭3 the lowest final note for the alto line in the hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Shadows Fall (#168)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the differences between the two types (whethe the bass note is high or low), we see that the low bass note version of 1-3-5-1 is most common among hymns in G major, with just a handful scattered among other keys. The one hymn that uses it in E♭ is Thy Holy Word (#279) and has the lowest bass note in the hymnal. The 1-3-5-1 final chord in B♭ also results in the highest final note for a tenor part, a D4 in Let Zion in Her Beauty Rise (#41).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThy Holy Word (#279)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet Zion in Her Beauty Rise (#41)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow often are you likely to see a 1-3-5-1 hymn? Again, there are many of them, including sacrament hymns, so it’s going to be pretty likely. Based on the 17,833 sacrament meetings I have data from, 31.5% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting use this voicing, which means odds are pretty good that, like 1-3-1-* discussed already, you’ll see at least one hymn ending in 1-3-3-5 on any given Sunday.\n\n\n1-1-3-1 endings\nThe next most common way to end a hymn is to use the 1-1-3-1 voicing. The bass, tenor, and soprano line are in three octaves, and the alto line sings the third of the chord below the soprano line. The most common non-sacrament hymn to end on this voicing is For the Beauty of the Earth (#93), shown below.\n\n\n\nFor the Beauty of the Earth (#93)\n\n\nA related ending is the one instance 1-*-1-3 in the hymn Thy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188). That C3 in the tenors is the lowest final tenor note in the hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188)\n\n\n\n\n54 hymns end in 1-1-3-1, so again, I’m not going to show all of them, but this plot shows how often the most common ones are sung in a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the key signatures of the hymns that end in this voicing, we see basically the opposite pattern from 1-3-1-* above. The hymns that use the 1-1-3-1 voicing are mostly in the G, A♭, B♭ range.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lowest iteration of 1-1-3-1 is in F major, which is found in six hymns, three of which are Christmas hymns. The highest version is in C major, as in The Morning Breaks (#1).\nSince there are fewer of these hymns, the odds of seeing them is slightly lower. They made up 15.8% of the dataset that I have, so you’ll likely to sing one about every two weeks.\n\n\n1-5-3-1 endings\nThe final type of final chord that has a significant presence in the hymnal is 1-5-3-1. It also spans two octaves, like other endings, but the voices are more evenly spaced. In my mind, this is the “Ice Cream” voicing because in The Music Man, it’s the chord that the barbershop quartet sings when Herold Hill is teaching them to sing for the first time and he gets them to sing sustained notes while saying “ice cream.” We see this voicing at the end of 42 hymns, including Now Let Us Rejoice (#3).\n\n\n\nNow Let Us Rejoice (#3)\n\n\nI should mention too that Ye Elders of Israel (#319) fits into this category, but the alto is voiced above the soprano line (and thus making it truer to how barbershop is typically voiced).\n\n\n\nNow Let Us Rejoice (#319)\n\n\nHere are the most common hymns that fit this category, sorted by how often they’re sung per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the other final chords we’ve examined so far, it seems like there are some key signatures in which they’re more common. In the case of 1-5-3-1, it’s most common in B♭ major and C major, but we do get it in a handful of other keys as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one hymn in the key of E♭ is What Was Witnessed in the Heavens? (#11). This is the highest version of this chord, and it means the soprano line ends on an E♭5, the highest final soprano note in the hymnal. The lowest version of this chord is in the key of F in We’re Not Ashamed to Own Our Lord (#57), which makes that C4 in the tenors the lowest final tenor note in the hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Was Witnessed in the Heavens? (#11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re Not Ashamed to Own Our Lord (#57)\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there are only 42 of these hymns, again, the odds of seeing them is lower. They made up 11.0% of the dataset that I have, so you’ll likely to sing one about every two or three weeks.\n\n\nNon-tonic soprano final chords\nThe remaining final chord voices are all pretty unusual and are only found in a handful of hymns. We’ve already seen that 16 hymns end the soprano line something other than the tonic and that all hymns end the bass line on the tonic. Of those 16, there are four different voicings. Here, we’ll ignore briefly the two that don’t have full SATB harmonies.\nNine hymns end with 1-5-1-3: We Ever Pray for Thee (#23), Master, the Tempest Is Raging (#105), God Speed the Right (#106), Lean on My Ample Arm (#120), Oh, May My Soul Commune with Thee (#123), Testimony (#137), Secret Prayer (#144), O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (#197), and The First Noel (#213). There is only one other hymn that ends with the melody on the third, Thy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188) and it has a 1-*-1-3 voicing.I won’t post images of the hymns since these are all shown already.\nOf the hymns that have the melody end on the fifth, there are two voicing configurations. Three hymns use the 1-3-1-5 voicing: Does the Journey Seem Long? (#127), While of These Emblems We Partake (#173), and Carry On (#255). Finally, Now the Day Is Over (159) ends with 1-1-3-5.\n\n\nDuets and Unisons\nA few hymns have specific instructions to sing it as a duet or in unison. I’ll probably do a more thorough treatment of those hymns in a later blog post, but for now, we’ll just focus on how they end.\nThough seven hymns begin as duets, five of them go into full harmony partway through. They are Jesus, Lover of My Soul (#102), I Stand All Amazed (#193), Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd (#221), Let Us Oft Speak Kind Words (#232), and Truth Reflects upon Our Senses (#273). However, two hymns are duets the whole way through. Keep the Commandments (#303) ends in a 3-1 voicing. The other is Love One Another (#308) which is marked as a duet, but at the end breaks into three parts (3-5-1).\nFinally, we get to the hymns that have at least some portion marked as unison. The hymns Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (#118), I Know That My Redeemer Lives (#136), Behold! A Royal Army (#251), and Carry On (#255), start in unison and then break into harmony, so they’ve been discussed above where appropriate. Called to Serve (#249) starts in harmony and then goes to unison. Other stay unison throughout the entirety of the hymn. Come, Rejoice (#9), As Zion’s Youth in Latter Days (#256), Families Can Be Together Forever (#300), I Know My Father Lives (#302), Teach Me to Walk in the Light (#304), God’s Daily Care (#306), and The Priesthood of Our Lord (#320) all end on the tonic while I Know My Father Lives (#302) ends on the third."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nSopranos almost always end on the tonic, and basses always do. Altos end on the root, third, or fifth all about equally, while tenors favor the third. A handful of hymns end with at least one moving part. There are four main final chords the hymnbook uses, with most of the exceptions being from non-tonic-ending soprano lines, duets, and unisons. These main four tend to be used more with certain key signatures, summarized in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I think is coolest finding—and maybe this is old news for musicologists and choral arrangers—is that the final chord voicing is somewhat predictable by the key signature. Hymns in the D♭–d range are often 1-3-1-*, hymns in the E♭–G range are often 1-3-5-1, hymns in the A♭–B♭ range are often 1-1-3-1, and while never the majority, hymns in the B♭–C range are often 1-5-3-1."

This is a continuation from the previous hymnal, which contained many more arrangements, including choir pieces with special piano accompaniment. I don’t think these hymns are intended to be sung as congregational hymns in sacrament meeting and with a few exceptions, I don’t think they’re sung much at all. Let’s look a little closer at these arrangements."

    "title": "Does anyone sing the women’s and men’s arrangements?",
    "section": "Types of Women’s and Men’s arrangements",
    "text": "Types of Women’s and Men’s arrangements\nWe can classify these hymns into a few different categories. First, we can group them based on the type of musical arrangement. Some of the hymns, like A Key Was Turned in Latter Days (310) or Come, All Ye Sons of God (322), look like most other hymns because they’re arranged in a normal SATB format with four voices throughout. Two of the women’s hymns, As Sisters in Zion (309) and We Meet Again As Sisters (311), look a little more like primary songs since the left hand is simplified, which makes sense because it would be somewhat strange to hear men singing either of those two. Similarly, the men’s hymn, The Priesthood of Our Lord (320) does not have full harmony lines written and appears that it is intended to be sung in unison. These two types of arrangements are both labeled “Women” or “Men” in the hymnal.\nThe other main type of musical arrangement is where it a special arrangement geared towards the voices of the gender they are for. For the women, this means it’s a SSA arrangement, with the alto on a separate staff as in Love At Home (318). The piano gets its own lines, meaning the hymn has a total of four staves, which is potentially confusing for some people at first glance. The men get TTBB arrangements, as in Oh Say, What Is Truth? (331). These are written with a tenor clef centered around C, which is essentially a treble clef but down an octave, which is intimidating at first glance and sometimes tricky to play on the piano. We could even further subdivide the men’s arrangements based on which tenor part has the melody. In most of these arrangements, the highest part has the melody, as in Come, Come Ye Saints (326). For three of them though, the highest singer gets a harmony line and the melody is below that, as in Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335). The women’s hymn The Lord is My Shepherd (316) and the men’s hymn School Thy Feelings (336) does a mix of these two, and the melody switches from one part to another. All of these special arrangements are labeled “Women’s Choir” or “Men’s Choir”.\nThe other way of classifying these 29 hymns is whether the hymn appears elsewhere in the hymnal or not. This classification is pretty closely correlated with the musical arrangement as well. For example, among the 10 women’s hymns, three are unique to women and don’t appear anywhere else in the hymnal; these three are also the ones arranged in a SATB-like format. The other seven women’s hymns are special arrangements of hymns that occur earlier in the hymnal in a SATB format.\nFor the men’s hymns, the correlation is not quite so tight. Of the six men’s hymns that are not full TTBB arrangements, four do not occur elsewhere in the hymnal. The last is Rise Up, O Men of God (324), which has a unique melody but the same lyrics as the TTBB arrangement, Rise Up, O Men of God (323), on the previous page. Of the 14 Men’s Choir arrangements, five are unique and don’t occur elsewhere in the hymnal (like See, the Mighty Angel Flying (330)), while the rest are arrangements of existing hymns, like Come, Come Ye Saints (326), including some pretty infrequently sung hymns, like Thy Servants Are Prepared (261). Then of course, Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (336) has unique lyrics, but the music is the same as Should You Feel Inclined to Censure (325).\nA summary of all these classifications can be found in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n\nTable 1: Women’s Hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nHymn Name\nArrangement type\nFound elsewhere?\nSung in Sacrament?\n\n\n\n\n309\nAs Sisters in Zion\nTwo-Part\nUnique\nyes\n\n\n310\nA Key Was Turned in Latter Days\nTwo-Part\nUnique\nno\n\n\n311\nWe Meet Again As Sisters\nTwo-Part\nUnique\nno\n\n\n312\nWe Ever Pray for Thee\nSSA\nHymn 23\nno\n\n\n313\nGod is Love\nSSA\nHymn 87\nno\n\n\n314\nHow Gentle God’s Commands\nSSA\nHymn 125\nno\n\n\n315\nJesus, the Very Thought of Thee\nSSA\nHymn 141\nno\n\n\n316\nThe Lord is My Shepherd\nSSA\nHymn 108\nno\n\n\n317\nSweet is the Work\nSSA\nHymn 147\nno\n\n\n318\nLove at Home\nSSA\nHymn 294\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Men’s Hymns.

Even though it is somewhat familiar to many Latter-day Saints, it would probably be somewhat confusing for some people to sing it in sacrament meeting because it is arranged such that what appears to be the “soprano” part is actually a harmony line. Next was Ye Elders of Israel (319), which was sung 10 times in my sample. The others were only sung once or twice. Musically, the hymns Come, All Ye Sons of God (322) and Rise Up, O Men of God (324) are like Ye Elders of Israel (319) and would be less awkward to sing in church because their arrangements are perfectly fine as SATB and wouldn’t throw off the organist or the congregants. But, it would be very strange to sing See the Mighty Priesthood Gathered (325) and Go, Ye Messengers of Heaven (327) because either the melody is in the “alto” line, like Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335), or the melody is too high for a typical member to sing since it is arranged for a high tenor."

As mentioned above, the previous version of the hymnal had more arrangements—some of which were full-on choir pieces—and they were removed in this 1985 edition. It makes sense to continue that trend. We don’t need to remove them completely though—I think they should be part of an online-only supplement that would be accessible through the church’s apps and website.\nIt may be the case that these hymns were kept in the hymnal with the intention of them being sung in Relief Society and Elders Quorum meetings. But now that we do not begin those meetings with hymns anymore, there is little reason to keep them. Maybe there is value in singing one of these hymns in some stake priesthood meeting or a women’s session of General Conference, and if the hymnal is treated as “canon” for what can or cannot be sung in church meetings, then it might be worth it to keep some in there simply to hold their place as canon. In my opinion though, an online supplement can serve that purpose.\nSome of these hymns can and probably should be repurposed and brought into the main collection of hymns. For example, Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335) appears to be the most common of these 29 hymns and it would be a shame to lose it. But, there is no reason to keep it as a men’s-only arrangement: simply rearrange it as an SATB piece and I suspect it could become a more popular one."

    "title": "What hymns are sung in October as a result of the Primary Program?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "October is peak Primary Program season. According to the Handbook, the “Children’s Sacrament Meeting Presentation” is held annually “during the last few months of the year.” The wards I’ve been in typically do it in October or late September. So, since we’re approaching the end of October, I thought I’d take a look at what congregational hymns are sung around this time of year, likely as a result of the Primary Program. It’s a little difficult to see what hymns are sung the most in October, because we have several other things going on, including General Conference and a Fast Sunday. So, if we ignore those for now, we can start to see what hymns emerge as being the most autumnal hymn.\nThe following table shows the top ten most common hymns sung in October, excluding sacrament hymns and General Conference–related hymns. The numbers are not huge—it’s not like we’re seeing a very obvious trend going on across the church. But, it is probably not a coincidence that I Am a Child of God (#301) and Teach Me to Walk in the Light (#304) are among the Top 3. These are most likely related to the Primary Programs.\nHymn\nWards that sang it in October\n\n\n\n\nI Am a Child of God (301)\n4.59%\n\n\nCome, Follow Me (116)\n4.15%\n\n\nTeach Me to Walk in the Light (304)\n4.08%\n\n\nI Know That My Redeemer Lives (136)\n3.64%\n\n\nBecause I Have Been Given Much (219)\n3.57%\n\n\nHow Firm a Foundation (85)\n3.19%\n\n\nI Believe in Christ (134)\n3.13%\n\n\nLord, I Would Follow Thee (220)\n3.06%\n\n\nChoose the Right (239)\n3.06%\n\n\nThe Spirit of God (2)\n2.81%\nBut, raw frequency doesn’t tell the whole story. You can see on this list that the other eight of the top ten most common hymns in October are hymns that are common throughout the year. In other words, of course Because I Have Been Given Much (#219) is common in October: it’s the most common non-sacrament hymn! In fact, those eight other hymns are among the top 13 most common non-sacrament hymns. So, this table doesn’t say too much by itself.\nSo, as a way to control for how popular a hymn is overall, I’ve done a different calculation that accounts for how much the hymn is sung within a particular range compared to not within a range.\nThe following table shows the hymns that are quite a bit more likely to be sung in October than in other months of the year.\nHymn\nSung in October\nPercent of October\nSung not in October\nPercent not in October\nTimes more likely in October\n\n\n\n\nI Am a Child of God (301)\n72\n1.35%\n321\n0.54%\n2.53\n\n\nAs I Search the Holy Scriptures (277)\n40\n0.75%\n229\n0.38%\n1.97\n\n\nCome, Follow Me (116)\n65\n1.22%\n409\n0.68%\n1.79\n\n\nTeach Me to Walk in the Light (304)\n64\n1.2%\n404\n0.67%\n1.79\nAs you can see I Am a Child of God (#301) makes the cut and it sung 2.55 times more likely to be sung in October than elsewhere during the year. Another children’s hymn, Teach Me to Walk in the Light (#304), is about 1.85 times as likely. As for the two other hymns, As I Search the Holy Scriptures (#277) and Come, Follow Me (#116), it’s not obvious to me why those might be sung more in October than in other months.\nFor what it’s worth, there are other children’s hymns that are more common in October, but didn’t make the cut because they’re more common during other months.\nThe following plot shows these select children’s hymns and how often they were sung throughout the year.\nSo, other I Am a Child of God (#301) appears to be the most October-concentrated hymn. A few other children hymns are also popular, but they’re either not frequent enough to be statistically significant, or they’re overshadowed by their usage in other parts of the year."

I have data from 421 sacrament meetings that are the last Sunday in October.

    "text": "We’ll start off by looking at sacrament hymns, or rather, the hymn sung immediately before the sacrament is blessed and passed to the congregation. As far as I can tell, §19.3.2 of the General Handbook has the only instruction about sacrament hymns, and it says that “[t]he sacrament hymn should refer to the sacrament itself or to the sacrifice of the Savior.” This instruction is repeated on page 380 of the hymnal.\nAs I’ve written already, I Stand All Amazed (193) is the most common hymn overall. So it should come as no surprise that a sacrament hymn is the most common hymn overall. It focuses less on the sacrament itself and more on the Atonement, so it could be used outside of sacrament contexts without feeling out of place. In fact, a quick look at the numbers suggests that it was, in fact, sung as opening and closing hymns at least three times more often than any other sacrament hymn. This may explain why it stands out as the most commonly sung hymn in sacrament meetings."

    "text": "Non-sacrament hymns\nOnce in a while, a ward will indeed sing some other hymn as a sacrament hymn. Many hymns were selected by at least one ward at least one time, but two stood out. They are O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197) and Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146). There is good reason for why these two were sung as sacrament hymns: if you look up “Sacrament” in the topical index in the back of the hymnal, it is a list of all the hymns from 169–196, but it also includes these two.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start with O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197). It was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every two per ward on average. Given that it feels like a sacrament hymn and like an Easter hymn, it is perfectly placed between the more on-the-nose sacrament hymns (i.e. those about the bread and water) and the more traditional Easter hymns (e.g. He is Risen! (199)). Perhaps some music coordinators noticed it in the Index and chose it because of that. But, I could see a music coordinator selecting it because they perhaps thought sacrament hymns went from 169–197 instead of 169–196.\nThe oddball though is Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146). In fact, it was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every 2.6 years per ward, which is only a little less often than O Thou, Before the World Began (189). It is not clear to me why this one is listed in the index as a sacrament hymn, but it’s not grouped together with the other sacrament hymns. The “Prayer and Supplication” category of hymns, which is what this is a part of (and rightfully so, in my opinion), is just before the “Sacrament” category. If it, like O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197), fits into both categories, then I think it should be moved to hymn 168 so that it’s less out of left field. This one really should be thought of as an honorary sacrament hymn. Perhaps we’ll see it included in the “official” list of sacrament hymns in the next hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for the next hymnal\n\n\n\nConsider putting O Thou, Before the World Began (189) immediately before the list of sacrament hymns."

Unsurprisingly, I Stand All Amazed (193) is at the top, being sung occasionally as an opening hymn and closing hymn. At only once every 5–6 years, it’s not particularly common to see it sung this way, but it’s still not unheard of. After that, there are a few others like ’Tis Sweet to Sing the Matchless Love (177) and Reverently and Meekly Now (185) were also used as one of the other hymns, but it was still quite unusual.\nOverall, while singing a specific sacrament hymn elsewhere in the meeting is pretty unusual, the odds of singing any of the sacrament hymns is more common since their frequencies add together. It happened in 226 of the 17,833 sacrament meetings I have data from, or 1.3% of them. That means, on average, a ward might since hymn 169–196 at some other point in the meeting approximately once every year and 8 months."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe findings in this section suggest that were have a strong tradition of singing hymns 169 through 196 in our sacrament meetings immediately before the sacrament itself. Some wards systematically cycle through them, which I believe is a perfectly appropriate thing to do to include the widest variety of hymns to the ward. Other wards pick and choose, which inevitably leads to some favorites being sung more and some lesser-known ones falling through the cracks.\nAs we’ll see when we look at holidays, wards do not always stick to the table of contents at the beginning of the hymnal when choosing appropriate hymns. However, in the case of the sacrament—which is the most important part of our Sunday worship and the primary reason for Sunday gatherings—it’s clear that we adhere strongly to the recommendation. Nevertheless, the addition of Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) shows that there is at least some room for thinking out of the box when selecting sacrament hymns."

    "section": "A brief note about my calculations",
    "text": "A brief note about my calculations\nLet me first mention my methods for how I’m calculating how often a hymn is sung, on average, per ward. I currently have data from 18,369 sacrament meetings. A ward will meet together for sacrament meeting usually 48 times in a year (52 weeks minus two for General Conference and minus two for Stake Conference). 18,369 meetings divided by 48 meetings in a year is about 382 years’ worth of sacrament meetings—far more than any one person could attend in their lifetime. So, if there’s a hymn that’s sung in just one of those sacrament meetings, that means it’s sung, on average per ward, once every 382 years. If a hymn is sung 100 times in my dataset, it’s sung on average once every 18369 / 48 / 100 = 3.82 years per ward.\nBecause I’m dealing with very sparse numbers in this post, the numbers may fluctuate wildly. As I collect more data, the exact numbers jump around quite a bit when we get to the very infrequent hymns. For example, if a hymn is sung three times in my dataset, that comes out to once every 127 years. If it’s sung just twice, it’s once every 191 years. That’s a big jump for a single data point. So, you should take these numbers with a grain of salt they mostly reflect how much data I have. Instead, I’ll group them into broad categories of “once a decade,” “once a generation,” and “once in a lifetime.”\nPlease note that I have removed the men’s and women’s arrangements (hymns 309–337) from these lists because, as I’ve already written, they’re probably not really intended or appropriate for sacrament meeting.\nSo, with that in mind, let’s most on to the least common hymns."

I like to think of The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37) as being “famous for not being famous,” particularly among LDS musicians, and with its high melody and tenor lines, unusual chords, and potentially offensive lyrics, it’s no surprise that it’s not sung very often. Some of these hymns are ones that the Tabernacle Choir sings but that I otherwise don’t recognize. Most of the hymns in the first half the hymnal, I hardly recognize at all. Meanwhile, the ones in the second half of the hymnal are ones that I recognize only because they’re interspersed among some of the more common, upbeat hymns in the 200-range. Overall, there is nothing too surprising here: there aren’t any hymns that I feel like are more popular than they really are."

There are 13 hymns in this category, which you can see in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHymn\nEvery X Years\nTimes Sung\n\n\n\n\nThe Happy Day at Last Has Come (32)\n27.3\n14\n\n\nZion Stands with Hills Surrounded (43)\n31.9\n12\n\n\nGlorious Things Are Sung of Zion (48)\n34.8\n11\n\n\nLet Earth’s Inhabitants Rejoice (53)\n38.3\n10\n\n\nBehold, the Mountain of the Lord (54)\n29.4\n13\n\n\nWe’re Not Ashamed to Own Our Lord (57)\n25.5\n15\n\n\nPraise Ye the Lord (74)\n38.3\n10\n\n\nGreat Is the Lord (77)\n25.5\n15\n\n\nWith All the Power of Heart and Tongue (79)\n34.8\n11\n\n\nAs the Shadows Fall (168)\n34.8\n11\n\n\nJesus, Mighty King in Zion (234)\n25.5\n15\n\n\nLike Ten Thousand Legions Marching (253)\n42.5\n9\n\n\nGo, Ye Messengers of Glory (262)\n42.5\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong this set of hymns, I only recognize one, As the Shadows Fall (168), and not because I’ve sung it in church, but because it’s one of only two hymns in the key of D♭. As far as the rest go, I don’t even recognize their titles.\nThe wild thing is that the current hymnal was published in 1985, which is 38 years ago. If these numbers are accurate, it means that these hymns might have been sung maybe once or twice in the entire lifetime of the hymnal!"

    "text": "Once in a lifetime\nFinally, we get to the seventeen hymns that are sung at most eight times in the 18,369 sacrament meetings I have data from. Again, keep in mind that because I’m dealing with such sparse data, saying something is sung once every 382 years is very approximate and just reflects how much data I have total. Instead, you should just think of these hymns as being sung once-in-a-lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\nHymn\nEvery X Years\nTimes Sung\n\n\n\n\nWhat Glorious Scenes Mine Eyes Behold (16)\n63.8\n6\n\n\nSons of Michael, He Approaches (51)\n382.7\n1\n\n\nSoftly Beams the Sacred Dawning (56)\n76.5\n5\n\n\nGreat God, Attend While Zion Sings (88)\n54.7\n7\n\n\nYe Simple Souls Who Stray (118)\n76.5\n5\n\n\nLean on My Ample Arm (120)\n47.8\n8\n\n\nI’m a Pilgrim, I’m a Stranger (121)\n54.7\n7\n\n\nHow Long, O Lord Most Holy and True?

Another way of thinking about these is that in the lifetime of a physical copy of a hymnal, there is a decent chance that most of these nine hymns were never sung.\nI recognize two of these hymns because they stand out in interesting ways. First, is Lean on My Ample Arm (120) which is my favorite hymn. There’s also Softly Now the Light of Day (160) which, at only two lines and one verse, is tied with the once-every-six-years Praise God, from Whom All Blessings Flow (242) for the shortest hymn in the hymnal..If you want to get really technical, Hymn 242 is shorter because its suggested tempo marking includes slower tempos.\nOthers in this list can be explained a little bit.\n\nHere we get the other hymn in D♭, Softly Beams the Sacred Dawning (56).\nWe Meet Again in Sabbath School (282) makes sense for being on this list because it’s likely intended to be an opening hymn for Sunday School, and not sacrament meeting. Although, we don’t start Sunday School with hymns anymore, so it’s likely not getting any currency anymore.\nThe hymn Come, Let Us Sing an Evening Hymn (167) makes sense since most wards meet in the morning.\nIt’s also not surprising that God Save the King (341) is hardly sung in my sample, partially because I don’t have a lot of data from the UK and the reigning monarch the entire time was a queen rather than a king.\nFinally, it seems like This House We Dedicate to Thee (#245) is intended for a building dedication which probably not very many people actually get to attend in their lifetimes. It’s a perfectly good hymn and very appropriate for the occasion—but regular sacrament meeting is not such an occasion.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, we actually sang God Save the King (#341) in Priesthood Opening Exercises, back when they had those. We did it becauase one of the young women from the ward was sitting in because she needed to make an announcement, so the Bishop asked her to give the prayer, because, how often do you see a young woman give the opening prayer in a Priesthood meeting? So, while we’re seeing things we’ve never seen before, we sang God Save the King (#341).It is interesting to note that, with a large enough sample and if you ignore the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back, I was able to find evidence of every hymn being sung at least once in some meeting somewhere."

    "text": "Overall Frequency\nTo me, it is wild to think that these 17 hymns (plus many of the men’s and women’s arrangements) have been printed in tens of thousands of hymnals for the past nearly 40 years and have hardly ever been used by anyone. On the plus side, these lists are somewhat small, especially the list of hymns never sung at all. It appears to be the case then that pretty much every hymn is sung at least a little bit. So, inflated claims along the lines of “there are 100 hymns that literally no one sings” simply aren’t accurate. They’re not common, but they are sung.\nIn fact, if we take all 67 hymns that I’ve listed on this page, and count up how many times they were sung, it comes out to 1,180 times in this sample, which is 1.85% of all the data. That means you might sing one of these 67 hymns once every four months, or about as often as I Stand All Amazed (193). Another way of thinking about it is that we could cut these 67 hymns, and it would affect about one meeting every four months.\nPerhaps a better way of looking at this is to think about how many wards sing a given hymn around the world. There are around 31,330 wards and branches across the world. Let’s say that the 18,369 meetings I have data are a representative sample with one ward contributing data all in the same week. That would be 58.6% of the congregations around the whole world. If one of them sings something like Sons of Michael, He Approaches (#51), we might therefore assume that perhaps maybe one other congregation around the world will sing that hymn in a given week. For comparison, if we apply the same logic, I Stand All Amazed (#193) would be sung in 1,755 different congregations every week.See more facts and figures published by the church here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should take that claim about how many wards around the world sing these hymns with a monster grain of salt for at least the following reasons:\n\nThe wards I have data from are not representative of units across the world. Roughly 85% of my data comes from the US, for example, while less than half the congregations in the world come from the US.\nWe can’t assume the 18,369 meetings are independent of each other because most wards contributed data from more than one sacrament meeting. So we can’t interpret them as coming from 18,369 independent wards in the same week.\nAs we’ll see in later posts, holidays matter, and the likelihood of singing any one hymn goes up and down depending on things like holidays, Fast Sundays, and proximity to General Conference. So the odds of singing these unusual hymns is basically zero the week before Christmas, but slightly higher in a random week in September or something.\nAlso, the type of music coordinators that keep spreadsheets are likely the ones who try to diversify the hymns they sing. There are likely many wards who do not have spreadsheets and may sing from a more limited selection throughout the year.\n\nI wanted to point out these caveats, but it’s still interesting to think about how many times these hymns are sung around the world on a given Sunday."

    "text": "Concluding thoughts\nIn this blog post, I took a closer look at hymns that are sung at most once a decade. Many of them were sung less often that that, if they were sung at all.\nBut should we cut these hymns? Unless there are issues with the text, message, or doctrine, I don’t see any reason why we should remove hymns per se. In fact, some hymns, like We Meet Again in Sabbath School (#282) or This House We Dedicate to Thee (#245) are/were quite appropriate in very specific, albeit infrequent, circumstances. So, should they be printed in tens of thousands of hymnals? In my opinion, probably not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for the next hymnal\n\n\n\nPut these special hymns into an online supplement to the hymnal, like what I recommend for the men’s and women’s arrangements. Make it clear that these are approved for use in the church and part of the “canon” but are simply not printed for practical reasons.\nAs for the special hymns that are useful for certain occasions, set them aside in a section called “special occasions” or something that would catch people’s attention. We don’t want them to be overlooked when those special occasions do arise. It would be a shame to lose these hymns simply because the occasions they are written for don’t happen very often.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation to music coordinators\n\n\n\nIt is unlikely that many people in your ward will be familiar with more than a few hymns listed on this page. If you want to be adventurous and try a really uncommon hymm, these are the ones to choose from. But, it might be good to help the ward out a little bit by having the ward choir sing it first, having the organist play it for prelude a few weeks prior, having the organist play the entire hymn as an introduction, and having the organist use play the melody on the swell (or use a melody coupler) with a reed stop pulled to make it easier to hear.\nRegardless of whether you use these hymns, you should get familiar with these techniques for introducing hymns to ward members because we’ll all likely need to start using them when we get the new hymnal anyway.\n\n\nFunny story. Someone contributed a couple years’ worth of data from their ward and I mentioned that they sang three of the most unusual hymns in the span of two weeks. The sister wrote back saying the music coordinator was released right after that and she was called with a special request from her bishop to sing songs people were familiar with. So, if you go too overboard, it might cost you your calling!If you have sung one of these 67 hymns recently in your ward, that’s pretty cool because few people can sasy they have!"

Subtract two for General Conference and subtract two for Stake Conference. You’re left with 48 sacrament meetings per year. If you sang an opening, sacrament, intermediate, and closing hymn in all 48 of those meetings, that’s 196 hymns. But, subtract 12 for Fast Sundays, which have no intermediate hymn.

Even if you exclude the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back, which are hardly ever sung, and (for American wards) God Save the King (#341), that’s 310 hymns.\nBut, let’s not forget that sacrament hymns almost always have to be one of the hymns in the 169–196 range. There are 28 of them. We’ll assume you get through all 28 of them, but not all wards do because there are a few that are clearly less popular than others. So, 48 of your 184 hymns are tied up as sacrament hymns, some of which will have to be repeated. That leaves 136 remaining opening, intermediate, and closing hymn slots. If you didn’t repeat any and had zero special musical numbers, then yes, you could sing 136 unique hymns, plus the 28 sacrament hymns, for a total of 164 unique hymns per year. That is the maximum any ward could do.\nIf you really were determined to all 310 hymns without repeating, except for sacrament hymns, it would take 94 weeks to do so, or just shy of two years, under perfect conditions. But having special musical numbers and ward choirs makes it impossible to reach that goal. (And I’d encourage you to not deny people the opportunity to do a special musical number just so you can hit this goal!)\nI currently have 63,307 hymns from 18,218 sacrament meetings. With this data, I can calculate how often wards typically sing intermediate hymns by simply dividing those two numbers. If the number is close to 3, then most wards sing 3 congregational hymns a week, meaning there’s a special musical number or for whatever reason the intermediate hymn is not sung. If the number is close to 4, then most wards sing four congregational hymns: opening, sacrament, intermediate, and closing. As it turns out, it’s around 3.47.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe average number of hymns sung in sacrament meeting is 3.47.\n\n\nThis means that means—across my dataset—only about half of the time does a ward sing an intermediate hymn. If, across a few weeks or months, your ward has a lower number than that, then you have more special musical numbers than a typical ward. If your average is higher, it means you have fewer.\nLet’s recalculate our numbers then. If there are 48 weeks, and 3.47 hymns per week, that’s a max of 167 (I’ll round up) total hymns sung per ward per year. 48 of those are chewed up by the 28 sacrament hymns, so you’re left with 119 slots for the rest of the hymnal. If you didn’t repeat any and add back the 28 sacrament hymns, that’s a max of 147 unique hymns per year. And if you’re only able to get through 2.47 new hymns per week, and there are 282 non-sacrament hymns to get through, it would take 114 weeks to get through all of them, or just about two years and four months."

I didn’t want to base the calculation on wards that contributed less data because it messes with the results.\nBut, even with these 108 wards, I can’t simply divide the number of unique hymns by the number of sacrament meetings because the more data I have from a ward, the more likely they are to repeat hymns, especially common ones and around holidays. Yes, I am also more likely to see an unusual hymn if I have more data from them, but it seems like the repeated hymns has a stronger effect. It appears to follow some sort of exponential distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, because of probability, it’s not meaningful to compare six years of data from one ward to one year of data from another ward.\nI tried a rolling cumulative sum of unique hymns, but I didn’t know how to implement that in R. So instead, I implemented a bootstrapping technique and sampled 48 meetings, without replacement, 100 times per ward, and got that average. The standard deviation was 3.16—a surprisingly narrow distribution if you ask me.\n\n\n\nAssuming about 24–28 of those are sacrament hymns, that means most wards only sing about 80 or so unique non-sacrament hymns per year. It appears then that another 28 of those 80 hymns are repeated each year.\nThe average is around 105, but that doesn’t mean all wards were close to that. 50% of wards were between about 97 and 111 hymns per year. Others do more and others do fewer. If you’re not sure whether your ward has enough variety, count the number of unique hymns in a 1-year period and if it’s in the low 100s, you’re doing alright.\nThe most variety of hymns I have in my dataset is 131 unique hymns per ward. That’s pretty good, and certainly much better than average. The year with the least variety was one ward that sang just 66 unique hymns in a year. Considering that many of the holiday hymns aren’t going to be repeated, it means that many (and perhaps most) of the non-festive hymns were repeated that year.\nThese numbers should be taken with a grain of salt because it’s only based on 108 wards. If you have access to a year’s worth of data from your ward, please visit the contribute page!For what it’s worth, a previous version of this blog post was written based on a much smaller sample of 20 wards. The numbers are more or less the same, which leads me to believe they’re reasonably accurate."

    "text": "Are there fewer intermediate hymns in two-hour church?\nSomeone suggested to me one time that the number of intermediate hymns we sing may have shifted once we switched to two-hour church (and thus a slightly shorter sacrament meeting) in January 2019. In their ward, they sense that intermediate hymns are being sung less, not because of more special musical numbers, but because it cut into the speakers’ talks and there just wasn’t enough time. This is a tricky question to answer because for much of the time since 2019 has been during covid. But, enough time has passed that we can try to answer this question.The Sunday I wrote this section, my ward did this very thing: we had not intermdiate hymn because we had three adult speakers.\nThe following table summaries how many hymns per sacrament meeting were sung in three periods: three-hour church (before January 2019), the “covid era” (March–December 2020), and two-hour church (all of 2019, January–February 2020, and January 2021 through now). Here we can see that the average number of congregational hymns sung in three-hour church was 3.36 and the average number of hymns sung in two-hour church was 3.24—a drop of about 0.12 hymns per week, or about one less intermediate hymn every eight or so weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblocks\nnumber of hymns\nnumber of meetings\nhymns per meeting\n\n\n\n\nthree-hour church\n56248\n16704\n3.367\n\n\ncovid\n300\n116\n2.586\n\n\ntwo-hour church\n5638\n1736\n3.248\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a plot that shows this trend across time, that might shed a little light on these numbers. Since I have data spanning over 20 years, we can see a long period of stability prior to 2019. Covid definitely disrupted the status quo; many ward only sang just one hymn as they resumed in-person meetings. However, 2019 numbers look pretty similar to the years before it. And there has been a noticeable increase since 2021. Only recently does it look to be as high as the pre-2019 era.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, singing only thee congregational hymns on a Sunday instead of four may be because a special musical number took the place of an intermediate hymn. But it could be because the bishopric simply chose not to sing a fourth hymn. With the data I have, I have no way of knowing. I’ll let you interpret these numbers as you will. But, it’s interesting to see the kind of lasting effect that covid had!\nSo, do we have fewer intermediate hymns since we shifted to two-hour church? Yes, but I think it’s because of covid than the length of sacrament meeting."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There are two hymns that stand out as “General Conference hymns”. The first is We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19), which is 3.50 times more likely to be sung within a week of General Conference than all the other weeks of the year combined. The second is Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) and is 2.81 times as likely to be sung within a week of General Conference than any other week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe two most typical General Conference hymns are We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) and Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21).\n\n\nHowever, to be clear, while the hymns are somewhat common, not all wards sing them around General Conference. Generally, We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) is sung about every 37.5 weeks in a ward. But, only 28.7% of wards sing it within a week of General Conference. To put it another way, a ward might do so once every seven General Conferences. The other, Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21), is less common generally and is sung once every 1.74 years, or rather, only 57% of wards will sing it in a given year. Within a week of General Conference, only 17.4% of wards will sing it, or a single ward might do it once every 5.5–6 years. So, singing General Conference hymns is not a terribly common thing.\nWe can take a closer look at the annual trends of these two General Conference hymns. General Conference takes place on the first Sunday of April and October. So, I’ve taken the dates of all the times those two hymns are sung and counted how many weeks they are until or since the nearest General Conference. I then tallied all the data, by hymn and by Conference (April vs. October), and produced the plot shown in Figure 1. General Conference itself is indicated by the dotted blue line. The shaded region is around the time that is seven days or less from General Conference.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Annual trends of General Conference hymns.\n\n\nHere we can see that these two hymns are literally centered around General Conference. In general, We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) (top panels) is the more common hymn. Around the April General Conference, it’s most common the week before, and two weeks after. In the October General Conference, it’s more common he two weeks before and one week after. Since it’s a popular hymn and a stable in LDS hymnody, it’s sung throughout the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief soapbox/rant\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t think We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) should be thought of as a hymn about prophets. Yes, the first two lines are about prophets who guide us in these latter-days. But look at the rest of the lyrics. We thank Thee for the gospel and every blessing and we want to serve Thee. The second verse is about how the Lord will deliver us. The third verse is a bit of a grabbag of topics, but prophets are not mentioned. This is not a hymn about prophets; it’s a prayer of gratitude and praise.\nHowever, it has become the prophets hymn. I mean, look how often it’s sung in General Conference! I think the reason for this is because the first line happens to mention prophets. Although, again, it’s within the context of a prayer of gratitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for the next hymnal\n\n\n\nWe should give this a new title and/or a new first verse. A simple change like calling it, “We Thank Thee, O God”, I think would go a long way. (Thanks, Daniel for the recommendation!) I think it’s appropriately placed in the “restoration” section of the hymnal, but I think it should be moved further from “prophets” subsection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for music coordinators\n\n\n\nConsider singing this hymn around Thanksgiving to highlight its message as a prayer of gratitude.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) (bottom panels) is less common overall. Around the April General Conference, there’s a slight increase in how often it’s sung, but not as clear of a spike. And I’m not really sure why there is a secondary spike four weeks after. There is a clearer spike after the October General Conference, and is most common two weeks before and one week after.\nIn general, the April spikes are smaller than the October spikes. This is most likely because General Conference competes with Easter in April, so wards are more likely to sing Easter hymns instead. So, around the October General Conference is when you’re most likely to hear these hymns.\nI can glean two interesting things from Figure 1. First, the General Conference “season” appears to start two weeks before and ends two weeks after the conference itself. I could imagine wards assigning speakers topics related to general conference (prophets, revelation, etc) leading up to it, and “what did you learn” or “what was your favorite talk” topics afterwards. Anything beyond that though, and there’s no evidence, at least in the hymns we sing, that General Conference is the focus of sacrament meeting.\nThe second interesting thing I see in Figure 1 is something we’ll see with other holidays too: music coordinators choose the less popular hymns further from the holiday itself and the more popular ones closer to the holiday. Looking at October, we see that the largest spike in the entire figure is for We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) the week before conference. Meanwhile, Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) actually has a drop during that same week. It seems like music coordinators don’t want to “waste” a “good” hymn on a less-than-ideal week.\n\n\nNow that we’ve established which hymns are sung and how often they are, let’s zoom into the sacrament meetings themselves. Figure 2 shows that these two hymns are both the most common as opening hymns. Interestingly, We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) is also pretty common as a closing hymn, but Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) is not. I’m not sure why there’s a difference in when these two hymns are sung during sacrament, but it would be intriguing to figure out why.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: When during sacrament meeting are General Conference hymns sung?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStats for nerds :)\n\n\n\n\n\nA \\(\\chi^2\\) test suggests that the different patterns between these two is actually not statistically significant: \\(\\chi^2\\) = 3.712, df = 2, p = 0.156.\n\n\n\nSplitting this plot up by weeks leading up to and following General Conference, we see that the clearest trend overall is to sing We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) as the opening hymn the week before General Conference. Besides that, it’s hard to point out any clear patterns, probably because we’ve stretched the data too thinly. (You can submit your ward’s data here!)\n\n\n\nFigure 3: An even deeper look into when these hymns are sung in sacrament meeting by week\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than two prophet-related hymns in our hymnal, but it turns out that very few of them can be considered “General Conference hymns.” Not only are they rare generally, but also there’s no noticeable increase in frequency around General Conference. Figure 4 shows a plot of all the hymns listed in the Topics index under the heading “Prophets,” in order of how common they are generally.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Annual trends of other prophet-related hymns.\n\n\nAs you can see, there are no appreciable spikes around conference season. The most common, Praise to the Man (27) is most common earlier in the Spring, presumably around the time of the First Vision. In people’s defense, Praise to the Man (27) is about a particular prophet, and doesn’t seem like the most appropriate hymn for General Conference. Come, Sing to the Lord (10) is more about the Restoration. Most of the other hymns are just not very common any time of the year.\nThe surprise for me is how uncommon other hymns that are very clearly prophet-related, that would be no less appropriate than the two more common ones, and that are right near the other two hymns in the hymnal are. We Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (22) is only sung once every 4.79 years per ward, or rather only 20.9% of wards sing it in a given year. There is a slight increase in frequency around General Conference, but, going back to saving the “good” ones for the prime slot, it’s most common two weeks before the October conference and one week after. We Ever Pray for Thee (24) is once every 6.76 years per ward, or in only 14.8% of wards. And God Bless Our Prophet Dear (25) is once every 7.66 years per ward, or in only 13.1% of wards. Both of these have very small spikes around General Conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation to music coordinators\n\n\n\nUse these prophet-related hymns more, especially if your ward has General Conference–related sacrament meetings around then. We have enough of them to sprinkle throughout the two weeks before and after conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though we have several prophet-related hymns, the two most common are We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) and Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21). While they’re sung throughout the year, they’re most common within two weeks of General Conference, especially as opening hymns. April conferences are less likely to see prophet-related hymns than October conferences because of competition with Easter. Some other prophet-related hymns are very occasionally sung around the General Conference “season.”"

    "text": "There are two hymns that stand out as “General Conference hymns”. The first is We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19), which is 3.50 times more likely to be sung within a week of General Conference than all the other weeks of the year combined. The second is Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) and is 2.81 times as likely to be sung within a week of General Conference than any other week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe two most typical General Conference hymns are We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) and Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21).\n\n\nHowever, to be clear, while the hymns are somewhat common, not all wards sing them around General Conference. Generally, We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) is sung about every 37.5 weeks in a ward. But, only 28.7% of wards sing it within a week of General Conference. To put it another way, a ward might do so once every seven General Conferences. The other, Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21), is less common generally and is sung once every 1.74 years, or rather, only 57% of wards will sing it in a given year. Within a week of General Conference, only 17.4% of wards will sing it, or a single ward might do it once every 5.5–6 years. So, singing General Conference hymns is not a terribly common thing.\nWe can take a closer look at the annual trends of these two General Conference hymns. General Conference takes place on the first Sunday of April and October. So, I’ve taken the dates of all the times those two hymns are sung and counted how many weeks they are until or since the nearest General Conference. I then tallied all the data, by hymn and by Conference (April vs. October), and produced the plot shown in Figure 1. General Conference itself is indicated by the dotted blue line. The shaded region is around the time that is seven days or less from General Conference.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Annual trends of General Conference hymns.\n\n\nHere we can see that these two hymns are literally centered around General Conference. In general, We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) (top panels) is the more common hymn. Around the April General Conference, it’s most common the week before, and two weeks after. In the October General Conference, it’s more common he two weeks before and one week after. Since it’s a popular hymn and a stable in LDS hymnody, it’s sung throughout the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief soapbox/rant\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t think We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) should be thought of as a hymn about prophets.

    "section": "Lowest melody notes",
    "text": "Lowest melody notes\nWhen we think of sopranos, we often think of high notes. We’ve already seen that while the soprano line can go as high as an F♯5 in Lead on My Ample Arm (#120), it typically goes up to a D5. But, sopranos do have to sing low sometimes too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe lowest melody note is an A♭3, which is found in The Star-Spangled Banner (340) and Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (118).\n\n\nIt is worth noting that that A♭3 in both songs is in a unison passage. In the The Star-Spangled Banner (340) all four parts are in unison and the soprano has to hit that note four times. That melody is notorious for being difficult for a normal person to sing because of its octave and a half range, so presumably they didn’t want to raise the key too much otherwise it would end up going very high. Its a lose-lose I guess.\n\n\n\nThe Star-Spangled Banner (#340)\n\n\nFor Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (118), the soprano and altos are in unison for the entire first half of the hymn. If you look at the same hymn in the 1948 hymnal (#290), you’ll see first off that it’s a “Choir” arrangement—yes, they had full-on choir arrangements in the back of the hymnal—so it’s probably a little more difficult to sing and maybe not intended for congregational singing. Furthermore, that lower melody line in the first half of the hymn is only written for the altos to sing. There may be a remnant of that in the 1985 hymnal because, if you compare the phrases where sopranos and altos are in unison in Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (#118) to The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37), you’ll see that in the latter, we have stems in the notes going in both directions, suggesting soprano and alto in unison. However, in the former, you only see one stem. Perhaps then, the intention is for altos to sing that first half of the hymn and for the sopranos to come in later.Please note the copy that I have is the 11th printing, dated 1957. It has a red cover. I don’t know enough about the various printings of that hymnal to know what differences there are between them.\n\n\n\nYe Simple Souls Who Stray (#118)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37)\n\n\nRegardless, this low A♭3 is, for both hymns, pretty exceptional.\nHow often will a congregation see one of these two hymns? Well, spoiling a bit of a future 4th of July post, I’ll go ahead and say that it looks like only about a third of the wards in the US sing The Star-Spangled Banner (340) every year. To put it another way, one ward might sing it once every three years, on average. Meanwhile, Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (118) is one of the rarest hymns in the hymnal and is basically a once- or twice-in-a-lifetime kind of hymn. So, sopranos, don’t sweat it if you can’t quite hit that A♭3."

    "text": "Other low melody notes\n\nA3\nNot too many hymns even approach that low A♭3. Just one hymn goes down to an A3. Zion Stands with Hills Surrounded (#43) just pops down there one time, unison with the altos, and never really comes close to it again. It is also extremely rare, being sung about once a generation or so.\n\n\n\nZion Stands with Hills Surrounded (#43)\n\n\n\n\nB♭3\nFourteen hymns have the sopranos going down to a Bb3. In all cases, the soprano line is in unison with the alto line, meaning there is no lower alto note being sung at that time. In some hymns, all four parts are unison when that B♭3 is being sung. We get that in Awake and Arise (#8), For the Strength of the Hills (#35), Hail to the Brightness of Zion’s Glad Morning! (#42), ’Tis Sweet to Sing the Matchless Love (#177), and Ye Elders of Israel (#319). In the case of Because I Have Been Given Much (#219), there is technically no alto part since it is marked as unison, but there is a G3 below it that could very well be an alto line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwake and Arise (#8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Strength of the Hills (#35)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHail to the Brightness of Zion’s Glad Morning! (#42)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n’Tis Sweet to Sing the Matchless Love (#177)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYe Elders of Israel (#319)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to note where in the melody these B♭3 notes come. For some hymns, it’s the first note of the song, it’s usually the dominant, and it never goes that low again. We see that in Awake and Arise (#8), For the Strength of the Hills (#35), Hail to the Brightness of Zion’s Glad Morning! (#42), As Now We Take the Sacrament (#169), and As Zion’s Youth in Latter Days (#256). In Joseph Smith’s First Prayer (#26) and Silent Night (#204), it’s in the key of Bb and the last note of the hymn is the lowest one. The rest have the low note somewhere else in the middle, but usually only one time. The hymn Ye Elders of Israel (#319) has that low note integrated throughout, including the beginning, a few times in the middle, and also near the end. Of course, it’s intended for men to sing, so we might not be right in calling it a “soprano” line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Smith’s First Prayer (#26)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilent Night (#204)\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, given that some of these hymns are fairly common, it is not unusual to see this B♭3. We have two sacrament hymns, a popular Christmas hymn, and three other very popular hymns. The other seven are not very common. But, collectively, these 14 hymns make up 5.2% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting. That means you’re likely to encounter one about once every 5.5 weeks on average. So, unless someone happens to know that The Star-Spangled Banner (340) goes down to an A♭3 and be familiar with two very infrequent hymns, I’m guessing a typical church-goer may think that a Bb3 is the lowest soprano note.Y’know, in case typical church-goers think about these things!\n\n\nB3\nOnly 11 hymns have B3 as the lowest note in the melody. It is here that we finally get alto notes below the melody’s lowest note. For example, in There Is Sunshine in My Soul Today (#227), as the melody goes down to a B3 in the chorus, the alto is below that on a G3. We also see that same thing in There Is Sunshine in My Soul Today (#227) and Up, Awake, Ye Defenders of Zion (#248). And in Onward, Christian Soldiers (#246), the altos are holding an A3. In all other cases, the alto note is unison with the melody still.\n\n\n\nThere Is Sunshine in My Soul Today (#227)\n\n\nIt is interesting to note though that as far as where in the melody that lowest note comes is quite different from where we saw the B♭3s in the previous section. Just one hymn, How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True? (#126), has the B3 as the first note. In all other cases, the lowest note comes in the middle of a phrase, usually near the middle of the hymn. I suspect this has to do with the key signatures that are most common in the hymnal. Since we have no hymns in B major, we don’t see B3 as the dominant, and since we have no hymns in E major, we don’t see it as the subdominant, with the exception of How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True? (#126). Instead, we’re seeing it as random notes of the melody. We get it as the mediant in hymns in G major (Testimony (#137), Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd (#221), There Is Sunshine in My Soul Today (#227), and Know This, That Every Soul Is Free (#240)), the submediant for hymns in D major (Where Can I Turn for Peace? (#129) and Onward, Christian Soldiers (#246)), a leading tone for Be Thou Humble (#130) and Called to Serve (#249), which are in C major, and as an accidental in The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37) and Up, Awake, Ye Defenders of Zion (#248).Incidentally, Hymn #126 is one of only five hymns in a minor key.I 100% had to look these terms up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Long, O Lord Most Holy and True?

Well, none of these 11 are sacrament hymns, so it’s not going to be as likely as B♭3. But, there are some well-known ones. Collectively, these hymns make up 3.16% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting, meaning you’re likely to see one about once every 9.4 weeks or so.\n\n\nSummary of low melodies\nSo, if we summarize these exceptionally low soprano lines, there are only 28 hymns (8.2% of the hymnal) that dip below a C4. If you have quite a high voice (or perhaps are looking for a hymn that a child could sing) and can’t sing below a C4, you’ll be able to sing the soprano line about 91% of the time."

This figure shows the distribution of lowest notes for the soprano lines in the hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe typical lowest note for a melody is D4.\n\n\nThis figure shows that the majority of hymns have their lowest note at a D4. There are 147 hymns like this, which is 43.1% of the hymnal. It is interesting that this parallels the highest notes in melodies, where D5 was the most common high note. In second place is C4, with 89 hymns or 26.1% of the hymnal.\nSimilar to the highest notes, relatively few hymns have C♯3 as the lowest note, again, likely due to the distribution of key signatures in the hymnal. It does include two sacrament hymns, O God, the Eternal Father (#175) and In Memory of the Crucified and a few other relatively common hymns. On average, you’ll see that C♯4 or D♭4 about once every 5.76 weeks."

    "text": "Lowest notes that aren’t all that low\nLet’s continue to work our way up to see what hymns have relatively high notes as their lowest notes.\n\nE♭4\nThere are 26 hymns that have E♭4 as their lowest note, including five sacrament hymns. Almost all of these 26 hymns are in the key of E♭ major and almost all of those have E♭4 as their highest notes. The exceptions are We Have Partaken of Thy Love (#155) and Now the Day Is Over (#159), which are in the key of A♭ major making the lowest note the dominant instead of the tonic, and all three of the women’s choir arrangements that are on this list: God Is Love (#313), Sweet Is the Work (#317), Love at Home (#318).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE4\nJust 13 hymns have E4 as their lowest note. Many of these are in the key of C major, but otherwise there’s nothing noteworthy to say about these hymns other than the most common of them is the only one sung on average once every two years. So, you’ll encounter one of these hymns maybe once every 14 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF4\nOnly nine hymns have F4 as their lowest notes. We’ll see in a later blog post that when the melody never goes too low, it makes the whole hymn “feel” high, even if none of the notes are especially high. Come, Ye Children of the Lord (58) and What Was Witnessed in the Heavens? (11) are the hymns with the highest “average” note, and not dipping below F4 certainly contributes to that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF♯4\nFinally we get to the confusingly worded “highest lowest notes” in the hymnal. Here, lowest notes refers to the lowest notes of the melody within each song out of all the other notes in that song. But if we take all those lowest notes and put them in order from low to high, one of them is going to be the highest. So, highest here refers to the highest across all the lowest notes. Thus, we have the highest lowest notes in the soprano line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nTwo hymns have soprano lines that go no lower than an F♯4: Awake, Ye Saints of God, Awake! (#17) and Raise Your Voices to the Lord (#61).\n\n\nIf you haven’t heard of either of these hymns, it’s probably because they’re not very common. Awake, Ye Saints of God, Awake! (#17) is sung about once every 8.6 years, typically as an opening hymn. However, though the soprano line indeed never dips below an F♯4, the melody goes lower. For one portion the sopranos have rests while the altos carry the melody. In the 1948 version of the hymnal, it was #229 and was a “Choir” arrangement, more or less unchanged except in the key of D major. So, this hymn only makes it to the top of this list because of a technicality, and my guess is a typical ward member people will sing that alto line anyway.\n\n\n\nAwake, Ye Saints of God, Awake! (#17)\n\n\nThe other hymn, Raise Your Voices to the Lord (#61), has an F♯4 as its lowest note fair and square. In fact, I wonder if setting this hymn in a relatively high key may have been intentional: it is called “Raise Your Voices” after all. In fact, when comparing the current arrangement to the one in the 1948 hymnal, I think there are cases where they deliberately made the parts higher. The bass line currently has C3 as its lowest note instead of the G2 in the previous version and the tenor line is pretty consistently above the bass clef. (The alto line is in about the same range and is is only different because the chords have changed a little bit.) So while none of the parts have extremely high notes, they are often in the upper parts of their ranges. If this was on purpose, that is some nice word painting. It’s too bad hardly anyone gets to enjoy that though because this short hymn is sung about once every 10.6 years, typically as a closing hymn.\n\n\n\nRaise Your Voices to the Lord (#61)"

    "text": "The highest alto notes\nThe first question is this: what is the highest note for an alto line? As it turns out, it depends on what you consider an alto line!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe highest alto note is a D5, which is found in five hymns: Saints, Behold How Great Jehovah (#28), Arise, O Glorious Zion (#40), Father, Thy Children to Thee Now Raise (#91), and Come, Let Us Anew (#217), and the women’s arrangement of The Lord Is My Shepherd (#316).\n\n\nHowever, we may have to qualify those a little bit. In the first four hymns, the alto is in unison with the soprano. I think it’s noteworthy that the alto only goes that high if it’s singing the melody (i.e. the soprano line) in unison for whatever musical purposes the arranger intended. I’ll leave it up to you about whether you want to consider that a true “alto” line, but I think it’s worth mentioning that detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaints, Behold How Great Jehovah (#28)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArise, O Glorious Zion (#40)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFather, Thy Children to Thee Now Raise (#91)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome, Let Us Anew (#217)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only other hymn that has an alto line that goes up to a D5 is in a really nice close harmony in the women’s arrangement of The Lord Is My Shepherd (#316). In this case, it is true that the alto line is not in unison with the soprano. But again, this is an exceptional case because it’s a women’s arrangement: there is another alto line below it (so maybe this is a second soprano line instead?) and it’s not intended for sacrament meeting.\n\n\n\nThe Lord Is My Shepherd (#316)\n\n\nOkay fine, so if we ignore alto lines that are in unison with sopranos and the women’s arrangements in the back of the book, the highest alto note is actually a C5, which is found in three hymns: Again We Meet Around the Board (#186), We Meet Again in Sabbath School (#282), and The Star-Spangled Banner (#340).As it turns out, there are a six of other hymns that have alto notes going up to a C5, but it’s only when in unison with sopranos again. They are Saints, Behold How Great Jehovah (#28), Rejoice, the Lord Is King! (#66), Glory to God on High (#67), God Speed the Right (#106), O Thou Rock of Our Salvation (#258), and America the Beautiful (#338).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain We Meet Around the Board (#186)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Meet Again in Sabbath School (#282)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Star-Spangled Banner (#340)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow often are you likely to encounter these highest alto notes? That high D5? Probably once a year. Looking at the C5 and D5 together, and that’s about once every nine weeks or so. So if you’re an alto and struggle to hit those higher notes, I’m sorry to say that you’ll probably see them a few times a year.\nSo there you have it. The highest notes in the hymnal are a D5, but that’s only in unison with sopranos or in a women’s arrangement, and a C5 in normal circumstances. Going forward, I’ll split the discussion into those groups (unison with soprano and harmony lines) where necessary, and will largely ignore the women’s arrangements since they are not really meant for congregational singing."

First, Figure 1 shows the distribution of highest notes in an alto line, excluding the women’s arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of highest alto notes (women’s arrangements excluded)\n\n\n\n\nHere we see something close to a pretty decent bell curve. It’s centered around G4, with some going as high as D5 as we’ve seen already, and some only going as high as D4 (we’ll get to those later). G4 is the most typical highest note for an alto line, with a whopping 125 or 111 hymns, depending on how you count them. Even though G4 and A4 are the most common, we have relatively few that have F♯4 and A♭4 as their highest notes, but, like we saw with the sopranos’ highest notes, this is likely because of the key signatures that are most common in the hymnal. My guess is if all 12 keys were more evenly represented, we might see a better-looking bell curve.\nFor almost every note, we see a few differences in height, based on whether we ignore unison passages or not, just like what was shown above with D5, where four of them only go that high when in unison with soprano, and only one is a “true” alto note. The next few sections walk through each of these notes, pointing out what hymns have what highest note and how the list changes depending on if we’re counting unison passages. Since we’ve already mentioned the hymns with D5 and C5 as the highest notes, we’ll start with B4."

Most of them are in the key of G major, and the soprano note at the point where the alto sings the B4 is a D5. Another thing they pretty much all have in common is that for most of the phrase that the altos sing the B4 in, the sopranos and altos are in parallel thirds. We see this in Love at Home (#294) and I Am a Child of God (#301). Here’s another example in Come Along, Come Along (#244).This pattern of high alto notes only being found in passages with parallel thirds extends to the three cases of C5 as well.\n\n\n\nCome Along, Come Along (#244)\n\n\nThe exception to this is in Have I Done Any Good?

I’m not going to dive into each one, but I can explain a few from each of the different categories.\nThe first are the six hymns that have A4 as the highest note but only when it’s singing the melody in unison with the sopranos. Here, we’re starting to get into the sticky area of what is unison with the sopranos because of a stylistic choice, verses unison because it made the most sense to do so for just one note. In something like O God, the Eternal Father (#175), it’s clearly a deliberate choice because all four parts are in unison. However, in something like High on the Mountain Top (#5), it’s technically in unison with the sopranos, but only because it would have created awkward voice leading to do otherwise. So, maybe I’m splitting hairs by creating these separate categories, but it’s hard to programatically determine which of these types of unisons we’re looking at without going through every hymn, and I don’t particularly want to go through every hymn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO God, the Eternal Father (#175)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh on the Mountain Top (#5)\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, there are relatively few hymns that have the alto line going up to an A4 only during unison passages. A full 54 hymns have “legitimate” alto lines—with soprano notes above them—that only go up to an A4. Instead of going through all of them, I’ll just show them here in Figure 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Frequency of hymns with A4 as the highest alto note\n\n\n\n\nI will mention that we now have a third category of hymns: hymns that have A4 as the highest note in the alto line if you ignore the unison passages. There are just two, and neither of them are very common hymns: With Songs of Praise (#71), which goes up to a B4 when singing the melody, and Arise, O Glorious Zion (#40), which goes up to a D5. The former is a clearer example of what I’m talking about. Again, technically, the alto is expected to sing up to a B4, but because that’s part of a unison passage with the sopranos (and all other parts), I’m ignoring it, and after I do, we see that A4 is otherwise the highest note.\n\n\n\nWith Songs of Praise (#71)\n\n\nTo summarize briefly the A4 hymns, there are 54 that for sure count. Another six fall into this category if we don’t mind including unison passages. Another two fall into this category if we ignore the unison passages and look at the next highest note."

Again, though, we’re splitting hairs a little bit, and these three really nice exemplify the continuum of how “unison” should be defined. For the Strength of the Hills (#35) is a great example of a case where the alto line goes high when singing melody, but not as high otherwise. Home Can Be a Heaven on Earth (#298) is a case where the highest note really shouldn’t be considered a melody passage and is only technically unison because of voice leading. Meanwhile, Abide with Me; ’Tis Eventide (#165) is somewhere in the middle.

All three categories of “highest notes” that we saw with the A4 hymns above are represented here though, so let’s look at each one of those.\nFirst, we can look at the hymns that have G4, but only when singing melody in unison with sopranos. Of the four potentials, Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (#21) is the only one that has a clear unison passage. The other three (Praise Ye the Lord (#74), How Great the Wisdom and the Love (195), and We Are Marching On to Glory (#225)) are only in this category because of voice leading.

Since alto lines don’t go especially low, these lines tend to have rather narrow ranges (which will be covered in later blog posts).\nOne example of such a hymn is They, the Builders of the Nation (#36). In my opinion, this hymn is set in too low of a key. The text and music suggest an upbeat, energetic hymn. The tempo marking even suggests to sing/play it “vigorously.” And yet, the alto line sits below the staff in a rather drone-like line, only reaching its highest note in the last line. I think it’s hard to sing too vigorously with such a line. The 1948 hymnal actually had this in B♭ major—a step and a half higher! Because of all this, I’m going to say something I rarely ever do, and that is I actually think this hymn should be transposed up from where it is! Perhaps the issue was that the tenor line was consistently too high. (I think the same thing could be said of Scatter Sunshine (#230).)\n\n\n\nThey, the Builders of the Nation (#36)\n\n\nAs for the sacrament hymns that only have E4 as the highest alto note, I’m fine with that.

If you’ve sung the alto line, you’ll understand that it’s not the most exciting line and could really use some of the movement that the tenors get. In all six cases, the altos hang around on that E♭4 for a while, unlike the higher hymns discussed above where they just pop up there once or twice.\nIn contrast to They, the Builders of the Nation (#36) that I discussed above, I think Now the Day Is Over (#159) is in the appropriate key.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was recently asked something along the lines of “how many hymns does a ward sing through?” Previously, I wrote that ward sing through about 105 unique hymns per year. However, the original question is slightly different than “how many does a ward sing in a year,” and the way it was asked implies that there are a certain set of hymns that a ward will pull from, and that there is essentially a “sealed portion” of hymns that are, for all intents and purposes, never used. My initial response was that there aren’t really hymns that are never used, it’s that not enough time has passed for them to be used. And then I thought it might make for an interesting blog post. So, let’s look at that a little more."

    "title": "How many unique hymns does a ward sing in a year? Part 2",
    "section": "The leveling out effect",
    "text": "The leveling out effect\nFirst, let’s think about what we expect to see. Given one year of data from a ward, we’d expect around 105 unique hymns. But, how many unique hymns would we expect in a two-year period? More than 105, but probably not 210. We’ll almost certainly be repeating sacrament hymns, most of the holiday hymns, and probably a fair number of well-known familiar hymns as well. So let’s say we sing maybe another 30 hymns in Year 2 that we didn’t sing in Year 1. What about a three-year period? How many hymns do we sing in that third year that we hadn’t already sung in Years 1 and 2? Probably not many at this point. Maybe another 10? How about a fourth year? A fifth year?\nSo, with each additional year of data, the number of new hymns being sung goes down. Eventually it’ll come close to leveling out, with maybe one new hymn a year or less. Mathematically, it has to level out because there are a finite number of hymns to choose from. But I don’t know of any ward that has sung all 341 hymns, so since there will almost always be at least one hymn that a ward has never sung, then it technically hasn’t zeroed out yet.\nWe can see this pattern in the data. Figure 1 shows how many unique hymns are sung, based on how much data I have from that ward. Each dot represents a ward and all wards in the entire dataset are plotted here. Most wards have less than a year’s worth of data, so they’re all plotted on top of each other in the lower left portion of the plot. But some wards have many more, and yes, I have almost 15 years of sacrament meetings from two wards!\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of unique hymns by years of data\n\n\n\n\nWhat we see is the leveling effect I described above. Most wards are around 105 or so after one year of data, which coincides with my previous blog post. By the two-year mark, the blue line, which shows something like the average, is around 150 unique hymns. But, the data has fanned out a bit, so there’s more variation in how many hymns a ward will sing in two years. Some wards are higher (up to 180 unique hymns in two years) and others are lower (around 120).\n\nLooking at specific wards\nLet’s look at how this plays out within the context of a single ward. Figure 2 shows the pattern for a single ward in the Pacific Northwest, which, for anonymity, we’ll just call the “Pacific Northwest Ward.” From left to right are the four or so years of sacrament meetings. The line goes up if that ward sings a hymn it hasn’t sung before based on the data that I have. It might be useful to think of the point on the left being the first Sunday after the ward was organized, moving right is how many years has passed since it was organized, and from bottom to top is how many unique hymns that was has ever sung since it’s organization. The line then goes up every time the ward sings a hymn for the first time in that ward. This is essentially what it shows, except the point furthest to the left is not from the ward’s organization but from the earliest sacrament meeting I have data from.I don’t know if I should be sharing ward names, so I’ll err on the safe side.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Unique hymns over time in a Pacific Northwest ward.\n\n\n\n\nThe general trend is that, as time passes, the ward will see fewer and fewer unique hymns. During the first six months, the line goes up pretty steeply—about as steeply as it can given the constraint of singing only about four hymns per week—because there are relatively few repeats in a six month period in this ward (and indeed in most wards). However, towards the end of the first year, the line gets a little less steep as some of the most popular hymns and sacrament hymns are repeated. At the one-year mark, the Pacific Northwest ward has sung exactly 100 unique hymns. Going into the second year, the line is noticeably flatter, and at two years, this ward has sung 140 unique hymns. So, during the second year, the ward sang about 40 hymns that it didn’t sing in the first year. The third year is more shallow still, and crosses the third-year mark at 165 hymns, meaning during that third year it sang about 25 hymns that it hadn’t already sung in the previous two years. At the end of Year 4, it’s at about 185, so it sang another 20 new hymns.\nSo, again, as more time passes, there are fewer new hymns. Now, that’s not to say that the longer a music coordinator is in their calling they choose fewer new hymns. Or that older wards have more repetition. Or that the first six months of a ward are the most interesting. It’s just that, with enough data, a ward will make it through more of the hymnal, and so there are fewer new hymns to draw from. There are diminishing returns when more time passes by. And there’s nothing special about the order either: if I were to put the dates in a random order, we’d see more or less the same curve.\nFigure 3 overlays two more wards to the previous plot, one from the Northeast and one from the Midwest. As you can see, the trend is generally the same: a steeper include in the beginning and a shallower rise after a year or two. The first six months look pretty much the same across these three wards, but after about a year, they begin to diverge. The music coordinator in the Northeast ward appears to have made more of an effort to not repeat hymns, while the Midwest ward sang some familiar hymns more often.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Unique hymns over time in a Pacific Northwest, Northeast, and Midwest ward.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 overlays even more wards. In fact, all 20 of the wards that have contributed three or more years of data are shown here in this plot. We see that in all these wards, the general pattern holds true. The first six months to a year are remarkably consistent for each ward and most of them are between about 100 and 110 unique hymns. From there, they really begin to fan out, and I think that’s where the effort that music coordinators starts to become more apparent. Most wards slow down at the pace that the Pacific Northwest ward shown above are at. Some repeat hymns more often, meaning they sing fewer new hymns, so their line levels off sooner. Some sing a wider variety of hymns, so their line continues to rise for longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Unique hymns over time in 20 wards.\n\n\n\n\nThe one ward that has contributed the most data (we’ll call it the “Southern Ward”) is also remarkable because they have sung the most unique hymns. Over 14 years, any ward is like to get through most of the hymnal, but the Southern Ward showed signs early on that they tried not to repeat hymns. Even in the first year, their line rose more steeply than the others, which means they were repeating hymns less often. And their line rose about as quickly during the second year—by the end of two years they had sung 210 unique hymns which is quite remarkable. That’s more than most other wards had finished after several more years than that. In fact, we can compare to the other ward that contributed 14+ years of data, we see that it took this Rocky Mountain Ward ten years to sing the same number of unique hymns that the Southern Ward sang in two years.\nThe Southern Ward leveled off though. In the last six or so years of data, they only sang about five hymns they hadn’t sung in the previous nine years. But, looking through their data, there are still 40 hymns (excluding the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back) that they hadn’t sung in those 15 years, so in theory, the line could still go up if they continue to contribute data.\nThe Rocky Mountain Ward came close to leveling off as well, and in years 5–12, they only sang about 30 new hymns. The most recent data I have from them, it looks like they made an effort to sing hymns they had never sung before. I don’t know the history of that ward, but the sheer fact that I have this data means they kept track of it. And if they kept track of it, perhaps they reorganized their spreadsheet in such a way that highlights hymns they hadn’t sung yet and they purposely chose to include those where appropriate.\nEach ward has its own story, but a few other wards are worth pointing out. Figure 5 shows three other wards’ data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Unique hymns over time in a Pacific Northwest, California, and Midwest ward\n\n\n\n\nThe Provo Ward contributed about nine years total, but their rise was inconsistent. They showed early signs of singing relatively few unique hymns and they began to level off by around three years. After two years, they had only sung 112 unique hymns, which is only a few more than what most other wards sing in one year. In their third year, they sang just nine new hymns. But then in their fourth year, they sang 30 new hymns and then leveled off again. For a year and a half (6.5–8 years in), they didn’t sing any new hymns. Then, they entered another phase of singing new hymns, and over the next year they sang 26 hymns that they hadn’t ever sung in the previous eight years. This is a very peculiar trend, and one that doesn’t just happen naturally. (A few other wards show similar patterns of leveling off and then rising again.) My guess is we’re seeing three different music coordinators over the course of these nine years, and the second two made a conscious effort to sing new hymns based on the spreadsheet that had been passed around.\nAnother interesting one is the Atlantic Province Ward, the largest contribution I have from Canada. They generally follow the same trend as other wards, but at around six years in, they seem to have short bursts of new hymns. Looking through their data more carefully, it seems like about every two weeks, the music coordinator chose a new hymn to sing. But then every about six months, two new hymns were introduced in a single meeting. The regularity of these bursts suggests that this was a conscious effort by the coordinator.\nFinally, I show the Married Student Ward, not because it’s interesting, but because it’s remarkably regular. It started out steep as expected and gradually leveled off with hardly any deviations from the general pattern in over nine years. To me, this is indicative that whatever system that ward uses to keep track of and decide their hymns hasn’t changed in nine years.\nOverall, most wards level off by around five years. Not too many wards have contributed more than that though so I can’t say for sure. But I think the leveling off that is apparent in finally gets at what the original question that sparked this blog post. For about 15 years, the Southern Ward sang only about 273 different hymns out of about 313 they could have sung. Rocky Mountain Ward drew from a smaller pool, about 244 hymns, in about 14 years. The Provo Ward leveled off for about a year and a half at 227 hymns and the Married Student Ward is close to leveling off at 208 hymns.\n\n\nConclusion\nSo, I can now answer the question of “how many hymns does a ward sing through?” I’ll say that a ward sings through roughly 210–275 hymns after several years. Of course, as I mentioned in the post about the least popular hymns, I have evidence that every hymn is sung at least once. So, not all wards draw from the same list of 210–275 hymns: some wards’ lists might be different than others. So, the ones that one ward will likely never sing will be sung in some other ward at some point. Together, they fill in each other’s gaps and collectively cover the entire hymnal."

Unfortunately, because I have relatively few wards that have hit that threshold, the data gets a little sparse, but hopefully I can provide a number that gets close.\nFigure 6 shows how many hymns these wards sang after a certain number of years. For each year, there is a boxplot that shows where most of the data lie, with the thick black line being the median. There is a clear leveling off effect as the years progress. (I’ve only shown through seven years because any more than that and the data gets too sparse.) Table 1 shows the same data but in tabular format.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: How many hymns have wards sung by a certain number of years?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: number of unique hymns per year\n\n\nyear\nmedian number of total unique hymns\nincrease\n\n\n\n\n1\n111\n111\n\n\n2\n152\n41\n\n\n3\n172\n20\n\n\n4\n196\n24\n\n\n5\n201\n5\n\n\n6\n210\n9\n\n\n7\n214\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way of looking at the same data is to turn it sideways and ask how long it takes a ward to hit a particular milestone of, say, 150 hymns or 200 hymns. Figure 7 shows those results based on the wards in this sample. Up until about 180 hymns, there is a pretty regular pattern. After that, we run into data sparsity issues, so the results are a little wonky. Again, Table 2 shows the same data, but as a table. We see then that it’ll take a ward a little over two years to sing 150 unique hymns. And about four and a half years to sing its 200th hymn.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: How long do wards take to sing a certain number of hymns?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: number of years needed to hit certain milestones\n\n\nunique hymns\ntime needed\ntime to next milestone\n\n\n\n\n20\n2 months\n2 months\n\n\n40\n3 months\n2 months\n\n\n60\n6 months\n2 months\n\n\n80\n8 months\n2 months\n\n\n100\n11 months\n3 months\n\n\n120\n1 year 4 months\n5 months\n\n\n140\n1 year 10 months\n7 months\n\n\n160\n2 years 4 months\n6 months\n\n\n180\n3 years 2 months\n10 months\n\n\n200\n4 years 6 months\n1 year 4 months\n\n\n220\n4 years 6 months\n\n\n\n240\n5 years 7 months\n1 year 1 month\n\n\n260\n7 years 6 months\n1 year 11 months"

    "text": "Simulations\nIf you’ve made it this far, it means you care about this topic a lot. It also means you don’t mind some quantitative analysis. In this final section, it’s going to get even more technical. So, if you enjoy this kind of stuff, buckle up because it’s going to get fun.\nSince I have data on how often every hymn is sung, I can treat those frequencies as probabilities. For example, since I Stand All Amazed (#193) is the most common, it’s most likely to be sung. Well, what if I randomly drew three hymns, with their probability of being drawn proportionate to how often they’re sung? If I do, I can get a random sacrament meeting like this:\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\nhymn\n\n\n\n\nOpening\nLet Us All Press On (243)\n\n\nSacrament\nHow Firm a Foundation (85)\n\n\nIntermediate\nI Believe in Christ (134)\n\n\nClosing\nThe First Noel (213)\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so it’s a bit silly because we have a Christmas hymn as the closing hymn, a Thanksgiving hymn as the sacrament hymn, and no real sacrament hymn. Well, what if I change the parameters so that it only selects sacrament hymns for the sacrament hymns? And since we don’t always sing intermediate congregational hymns each week, I can have it return an NA about 46% of the time to match how often intermediate hymns are actually sung. With those, I can get a perhaps more plausible selection:\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\nhymn\n\n\n\n\nOpening\nFar, Far Away on Judea’s Plains (212)\n\n\nSacrament\nAgain, Our Dear Redeeming Lord (179)\n\n\nIntermediate\nNA\n\n\nClosing\nPraise to the Man (27)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, I’m not going to worry about holiday hymns because it’d be too much of a hassle. But, with this random hymn generator, I can quickly simulate a sacrament meeting’s hymn selections. Well, what if I repeat that many times? Like 48 times? That’s a year’s worth of sacrament meetings. And what if I simulate more than that?\nWell, so that’s what I did. I simulated several years’ worth of sacrament hymns for a ward. The hymns are randomly selected, with more commonly sung hymns in real life being more likely to be selected in the simulation. I then went through the same calculations as I did with the wards shown in Figure 4 to see how this simulated ward compared. Figure 8 shows what this simulated data looks like. For now, I’ll just show the first seven years of the simulation since that’s about as far as we could do with the real data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Unique hymns by year if hymns are randomly selected based on observed frequencies\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, the leveling off looks very much like what most of the wards shown above look like. The first year sees the most number of hymns and with each passing year, the line gets shallower and shallower. After about seven years, this simulated ward has sung 243 unique hymns, which is in line with what was mentioned above about how many hymns a ward sings before leveling out. We see such a pattern in real-life too: the Married Student Ward shown above looks very much like this, though the line doesn’t quite get so high as in this simulation.\nHowever, this ward doesn’t appear to be leveling out. It’s still going up. How long did it take for the leveling out to happen? Better yet, how long did it take for all 313 of the hymns to be sung? Since this is simulated data, I can just generate some more data. So, I simulated 1000 years of sacrament meetings—which is nonsensical since for so many reasons: the hymnal has only been around for 38 years, the Restoration was only 193 years ago, the oldest hymn was written maybe 500 years ago, and heck we were speaking Old English back then. But, I can simulate it anyway to see what happens. Figure 9 includes the full dataset up until the points where it sings the last hymn. Here, I’ve added a horizontal dashed line at 313 to show the target. It took this simulated ward 213 years to sing all 313 hymns! It made it to 300 hymns in just 37 years, 308 hymns in 70 years, and from there at least a decade passed before hitting each of the remaining five hymns. Unsurprisingly, the last hymn was what is currently the rarest hymn in my sample, Sons of Michael, He Approaches (51).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Unique hymns by year if hymns are randomly selected based on observed frequencies\n\n\n\n\nSince those last few hymns were so infrequent, it makes sense that they took so long for simulation to get them. So, just to see what would happen, I changed the parameters of the simulation so that all hymns are equally common. How does that change the simulation? In this simulation, it took 8–9 years to hit the 313th hymn. Figure 10 shows that it takes far less time to reach the goal of 313 hymns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Unique hymns by year if hymns are randomly selected with equal probabilities\n\n\n\n\nSo, I have two versions of simulated wards. What I can now do is overlay that over the actual data, as in Figure 11. Here we see some pretty interesting comparisions. Obviously, the simulated ward that treated all hymns as equal skyrockets to the top and hits the 313th hymn sooner than other wards even hit (or are projected to hit) their 213th hymn. Even within the first year, we see that that Unweighted Simulation ward is ahead of the curve and hits 146 unique hymns by the end of the first year. By the end of the second year, it’s at 225 hymns, which is 75 hymns more than what real wards typically are at at that point, and is more than where most wards get even with many more years of data. Obviously, this is unrealistic and no one should compare their ward to this one; it really should be treated as the fastest a ward could reasonably sing all the hymns, barring systematic cycling through them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Real data compared to simulated data\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps more intersting is to look at the “Weighted Simulation Ward.” At one year, it is exactly on par with real wards. In fact, at two, three, and four years, it’s in the middle of the pack. After that point, real wards begin to level out while the simulated ward continues to rise. It only crosses the Southern Ward—which I’ve already pointed out as being pretty ambitious at singing through all the hymns—after about 15 years.\nSo, how do we interpret this data? The Weighted Simulation Ward pulls ahead of the pack while most real wards slow down. What is the difference then between the Weighted Simulation and the real wards? Well, real wards are run by real people. I do not want to discount any inspiration or spiritual promptings that may guide music coordinators in their decisions. But, real people have biases. And based on everything we’ve seen on this blog post, it appears that these biases mean that some music coordinators just don’t want to sing a certain set of hymns. Since the simulation has no such bias, it’s going to pick those unfamiliar hymns whenever the random number generator tells it to. So while the simulated ward pulls ahead, occasionally singing new hymns every once every few months or years, the real wards slow down and level off. As discussed already, some wards level off sooner than others, indicating that the avoidance of hymns is stronger in some people. The way this bias plays out in real life is that instead of singing an unusual hymn when it might be appropriate, a music coordinator will opt to sing a more familiar hymn instead.\n\nSimulating the new hymnal\nThe last thing I want to do is simulate what these plots might look like ten years after the release of the new hymnal. I haven’t done much speculation about the new hymnal yet, but simulations are an interesting way to maybe see what the future might hold. The new one is supposed to have 450–500 hymns because it includes primary songs as well. I don’t know how that’ll work, like if the primary hymns will be intended to be sung in sacrament meeting or not, but let’s say they are. That means we’ll have well over 100 more hymns to draw from in the coming years.\nThe obstacle I have right now in my simulations is that I don’t have any information about how common those new hymns are. My probabilities for the existing hymns are based on frequencies, but I can’t do the same thing for hymns that haven’t been released yet! So, what I’ve done is essentially put the existing hymns in order of frequency, and then randomly intersperse another 163 more pretend-hymns and just assume that their frequency is the same as hymns nearby on the list. So, some new hymns will catch on and will be very common while others won’t. This brings the total number of hymns up to 475, which is in the middle of the expected range. If a new hymn was randomly placed immediately below a sacrament hymn, I considered that new hymn to be a sacrament hymn as well. I then simulated another 10 years of sacrament hymns from a single ward. Figure 12 compares this simulation to the existing simulation based on the existing hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Predicted unique hymns per year for the new, larger hymnal\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so we immediately see that if there are more hymns to choose from, the number of unique hymns per ward increases. This makes sense: there are more to draw from so there’s less repetition. After a year, instead of having sung around 100 hymns, the new hymnal simulation suggests we’ll be at around 130 or so, which is quite a bit more than normal. Keep in mind that the simulation based on the existing hymnal was pretty close to what actual wards do for the first few years, so we can expect the same to be true of this new simulation. The only ward that hit 130 unique hymns in the first year was that Southern Ward, which, as already mentioned, appears to make an effort to sing many different hymns. So, once the novelty of the new hymnal comes out and things settle down into a new normal (so, maybe by the mid 2030s), we might expect that the diversity of sacrament hymns in a typical ward would be similar to what this one exceptional ward is doing now.\nThe difference between the current and new hymnal simulations gets greater as more time passes. By two years, the typical ward might have sung more hymns than any ward I have data for. After a few more years, the simulation likely overestimates the number of hymns sung in a ward because that’s what we saw with the other simulation. But, if I were to hazard a guess, I’d say after five or so years, a typical ward might settle on an expanded list of 325 hymns rather than the current observation of around 240."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nSo, let’s go back to the original question once again: “how many hymns does a ward sing through?” What seemed like an innocent question actually turned out to uncover some interesting patterns. What we’ve found is that it takes at least five years for a ward to “settle” on the set of hymns that they ultimately draw from, which is roughly 240 hymns give or take a couple dozen. Some wards will make efforts to sing more, while others have a larger list of hymns they’ll likely never sing. We observe a natural leveling out over time, so that fewer new hymns are sung the longer data is kept. Disruptions in this leveling out are likely due to changes in personnel and (my guess) probably involve careful notes about hymns that have been sung. Since new hymns typically appear gradually less often, it takes longer to hit milestones. It takes just one year to sing 100 hymns, about two to sing 150, and four to sing through 200 hymns.\nSimulated data further reveals these biases that humans have. Assuming hymns are all eligible to be selected for sacrament meeting, with probabilities mirroring their frequencies, the simulated ward is on par with the real wards in this sample, but only for the first few years. After that, the real wards level out, suggesting that, at some point, music coordinators are opting to repeat a hymn rather than introduce a new one. The simulated ward continues to sing new hymns, but it took over 200 years to finally get to all of them! To me, this suggests that unless a ward makes a conscientious effort to sing every hymn, it is highly unlikely that you’ll sing all the hymns in the hymnal, even if you tracked them for your whole life! The simulations also reveal that once the new hymnal is introduced, we will likely see a wider variety of hymns being sung in sacrament meeting, with fewer repetitions.\nThis was a long and technical post, but I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it!"

    "text": "The most common hymns\nThe most common hymns sung in the church, according to my data, are displayed in the figure below. Here, sacrament hymns are in gray and other hymns are in black. I’ve shown only the hymns that are sung, on average, one or more times per year per ward. Since I’ve already posted about the sacrament hymns, I’ll focus now on just the non-sacrament hymns.You may think that a lot of hymns that pertain to specific holidays would make it onto this list, but as we’ll see in later blog posts about annual trends, there are actually relatively few festive hymns that are sung by most wards most years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows nice list of 24 hymns that are probably well-known by most members of the church, like I Know That My Redeemer Lives (#136), How Firm a Foundation (#85), and Because I Have Been Given Much (#219). They are generic enough to be appropriate for most meetings. Their message is centered on Christ and other foundation tenents of our religion. Some are more common around certain holidays, like Come, Come Ye Saints (#30) around Pioneer Day in Utah or Love At Home (#294) around Mother’s Day, but they’re also general enough to be appropriate at other times of the year as well. Thus, what we see in the figure above is a solid list of the most popular hymns in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nThis figure also shows how common each of these hymns are. Because I Have Been Given Much (219) is sung about 1.6 times per year, or once every 7.5 months. How Firm a Foundation (#85) and were about once every 7–8 months. I Know That My Redeemer Lives (#136) was sung, on average, 1.5 times per year per ward, or about once every six or so months. Lord, I Would Follow Thee (#220) and We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (#19) were once every 8–9 months. I Believe in Christ (134), Now Let Us Rejoice (3), and High on the Mountain Top (5), The Lord Is My Light (#89), and Come, Follow Me (#116) were once every 8–9 months. The rest were less than once every 10 months but still at least once a year. Of course, your ward may sing these more or less often than what is shown here, but this is the average across all the wards I have data from.\nTo contrast this, about nine sacrament hymns are sung, on average, more than twice a year. Keep in mind that there are only 48 sacrament meetings per year, and 28 sacrament hymns to choose from, so many will have to double up. None of the non-sacrament hymns were sung, on average, more than twice a year.\nThis list of favorites is useful because if you are a new ward organist, these are the hymns to practice first. Learning these 24 hymns (plus the sacrament hymns) will get you the most mileage. In fact, these 49 hymns account for 44.3% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting in this sample. That means that if you learn the hymns shown in the figure above, you’ll be able to play almost half of the meetings in your ward.\n\nAre these the “standards”?\nIt is interesting to compare this list of the most popular hymns, which I’m calling the “favorites,” to the list in the back of the hymnal under the section “Hymns for Stake Conference” (page 381). That section lists “standard, well-known hymns” and it is implied that many members would have these hymns memorized. Interestingly, there is not a lot of overlap between these lists. The following figure shows which hymns appear in the figure above and are usually sung more than once a year (excluding sacrament hymns), and which are the “standards” listed in the back of the hymnal. This time, the hymns in purple are ones that are recommended as “standards” and are indeed sung pretty regularly. The blue ones are what are sung pretty often but are not one of “the standards” listed in the back of the hymnal. The red ones are recommended “standards” that are not as popular. Most of lesser-popular “standards” are still sung pretty regularly, usually at least once every two years. The exception is Come, O Thou King of Kings (#59), which is sung less than once every two years and is not what I would consider to be a popular hymn.\nHowever, it should be kept in mind that this isn’t exactly a fair comparison. For one, this list of “standards” is what is recommended for stake conference, which is not the same as sacrament meeting. Also, this list printed in the back of the hymnal is presumably what was recommended in 1985 when this hymnal was first published. What is considered a standard has surely changed in the past few decades. Furthermore, many of the currently most popular hymns were new additions to the 1985 hymnal, including Because I Have Been Given Much (#219), I Believe in Christ (#134), I Am a Child of God (#301), and Called to Serve (#249). It makes sense that they’re not recommended in the back of the hymnal because they were brand new when that list was published! How could they have know they’d be so popular? My recommendation for the church would be to update the list of stake conference recommendations to include these most popular hymns and to remove the ones that are less common today."

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nIn other Christian traditions, the term Advent is used to describe the four or so weeks leading up to Christmas, with the “Christmas season” being used to describe a period of twelve days starting with Christmas. For whatever reason, most members of the church don’t use the term Advent and any traditionally Advent and Christmas hymns are pooled together under a generic label of “Christmas.”\nIn this post, I’ll largely ignore the difference between Advent and Christmas in my terminology. But, since this post does focus on the four or so Sundays leading up to Christmas (the Sunday after Christmas is treated in a separate blog post here), those of you who maintain the difference can think of this post as being focused on Advent.\nA look at the table of contents in the hymnal shows that the Christmas hymns are hymns 201–214. But the music coordinator faces the difficult task of figuring out which hymns to sing. There are usually not quite enough Sundays in December to sing all of them, so some will have to be prioritized over others. There are also usually a couple special musical numbers to work around, and I think many music coordinators try not to have the congregation sing a hymn if it’s already going to be heard in a musical number that season. So, with that in mind, let’s look at the data."

    "text": "How many Christmas hymns per season\nIt’s not likely that all 14 Christmas hymns will be sung by the congregation in any one ward within a year. There are, at most, six Sundays to work with in the Christmas season (click below to see details).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical details for calendar nerds :)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a little tricky defining the Christmas season, so I put together a quick spreadsheet to visualize the seven different possible Christmas seasons. You can view it here or download it yourself here.\n\nTraditionally, Advent starts the fourth Sunday before Christmas, which would be November 27th at the earliest and December 3rd at the latest. However, because we don’t traditionally celebrate Advent like other Christian denominations, people have different ideas for when Christmas hymns can be sung. For some, it’s the Sunday after Thanksgiving (in the United States). For others, it’s the first Sunday in December.\nOnly if Thanksgiving is at late as it can be, November 28th, do those three align and everyone can agree that the following Sunday, December 1st, is when Christmas hymns can be sung. If Thanksgiving is early, either the 22nd or the 23rd, then the Sunday after Thanksgiving will be the 25th or 26th, which is five Sundays before Christmas, and not technically Advent. So if Christmas hymns are sung then, Advent- and December-sticklers will say it’s too early; a week later will be December 2nd and 3rd and post-Thanksgiving sticklers will say it’s too late. If Thanksgiving falls between the 24th and the 27th, then the Sunday after will be the start of Advent but still in November. So if Christmas hymns are sung then, it’ll make the Advent and post-Thanksgiving people happy, but the December-sticklers will feel it’s too early.\nThe end of Christmas also has three possible dates. Some feel that the Christmas season ends on December 25th, so singing anything after Christmas Day is extending it too far. Others are fine going through December. Traditionally though, the Twelve Days of Christmas (or “Twelvetide”) starts on December 25th, meaning the last day of Christmas is January 5th. Here, you can’t satisfy all three groups. If Christmas is on a Monday or Tuesday, then there’s only one Sunday during Twelvetide and it’ll be December 30th or 31st. If Christmas is on a Sunday, you get one more Sunday during Twelvetide, and that’ll be on New Year’s Day. If Christmas is on a Wednesday through Saturday, there will be one Sunday after Christmas in December and another Sunday in January still part of Twelvetide.\nBecause of the way the calendars line up, there will always be exactly six Sundays between Thanksgiving and the end of Twelvetide. The years where Christmas is on a Monday or Tuesday are also the years that Thanksgiving is on the 22nd or 23rd (the earliest it can be), and you get four Sundays in December before Christmas, one extra Sunday after Thanksgiving before Advent technically starts and one Sunday at the end of December within Twelvetide. In all other cases, the Sunday after Thanksgiving is also the start of Advent and you get four Sundays before Christmas, and two during Twelvetide (one in December and one in January).\n\n\n\nSo, if the congregation sings the opening, intermediate, and closing hymn each week, that’s twelve slots to fill. And if the ward sings two more the Sunday after Christmas, then they can finally get all 14 hymns. So unless there’s some sort of special program that involves lots of congregational singing, it takes a minimum of five Sundays to get through all 14 Christmas hymns. Even if you extend into the first week of January, there are only six Sundays to work with and 18 slots to choose from. And since most wards probably have at least a couple special musical numbers, that cuts into the slots for congregational singing.\nSo, how many Christmas hymns does the congregation sing per Christmas season? Here, I’ll just focus on the wards that contributed an entire Christmas season’s worth of hymns. Specifically, they contributed at least five Sundays of hymns between November 27th and January 5th. Some wards contributed more than one Christmas season’s worth of hymns, and that’s fine. In total, I currently have 308 ward-years’ worth of Christmas hymns.\nFigure 1 shows how many different Christmas hymns the congregation sings in a single Christmas season. The average is just eight, with most wards falling somewhere between five and eleven. Five wards did manage to sing all 14 Christmas hymns in a single season. For three of those though, it was aided by multiple intermediate hymns the Sunday before Christmas, presumably as part of a special Christmas program. But, that also means that for two of the wards, they managed to get through all 14 hymns the “normal” way. But just two out of 308 is 0.6% of wards. So, not very likely to happen in your ward. And yes, there were three wards that sang just two Christmas hymns in the entire season (probably to the chagrin of their ward members)!\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of Christmas hymns per ward per Christmas season\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nSo, you’ll likely sing eight Christmas hymns as a congregation in your ward this year, give or take a few."

    "text": "Popularity of Christmas hymns\nMusic coordinators have the tricky task of trying to balance competing forces like Thanksgiving hymns, Fast Sunday, and New Year’s Hymns. In fact, in my ward growing up, we always sang Joseph Smith’s First Prayer (#26) to celebrate Joseph Smith’s birthday on December 23rd. Not to mention working around special musical numbers. So, some Christmas hymns are going to have to be cut. So, let’s look at how common each Christmas hymn is. Figure 2 shows the 14 Christmas hymns, ordered by how often they’re sung.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Popularity of Christmas Hymns\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Beloved” Christmas hymns\nThe way I see it, we’ve got roughly three “tiers” of Christmas hymns. The top six or so are what I’d call the most “beloved” ones: Joy to the World (#201), O, Come, All Ye Faithful (#202), Hark! the Herald Angels Sing (#209), Angels We Have Heard on High (#203), Silent Night (#204), and The First Noel (#213). Here we see that they’re each sung by the congregation, on average, in about 80% of wards each year. My guess is that if they’re not sung by the congregation, they’re probably sung by a ward choir or otherwise “covered” in a special musical number.\nThe most common is Joy to the World (#201). While it’s not surprising to me to see it at the top of the list, what is surprising is to see that it actually averages almost exactly once per year per ward. On the surface, that seems fine, because, yeah, we’d expect most wards to sing it. But, not every ward will sing it every year. Sometimes the choir will, or, for whatever reason, some wards just might not sing it at all. That’s why the other popular Christmas hymns, and indeed any other holiday hymn, come in at less than once per year. No, the reason why Joy to the World (#201) is so high is because some wards sing it twice a year. Specifically 32 of the 308 (10.4%) ward-years I’m looking at sang it twice in a single Christmas season. One ward even sang it three times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional detail on repeating hymns\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows how many wards repeat each of the Christmas hymn per year. As you can see, Joy to the World (#201) is repeated the most, but every hymn is repeated at least some of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: How often each Christmas hymn is repeated each year\n\n\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, there’s actually nothing special about Joy to the World (#201) that leads it to being sung more than once a year. How often a hymn gets repeated within a ward per year is simply a function of how common that hymn is. In other words, the amount of times a Christmas hymn is repeated each year is proportional to the number of times it’s sung overall.\n\n\n\nIt’s not clear to me why Joy to the World (#201) is the most common congregational Christmas hymn. I’ll leave that to the musicologists to answer. It may be the case that, of all the “beloved” hymns, Joy to the World (#201) is just not commonly sung as a special musical number, so the congregation sings it the most instead. It’s just interesting to me that some wards will repeat this hymn if they have a slot to fill rather than sing some of the less common Christmas hymns like While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks (211).\n\n\nThe “Filler” Christmas hymns\nGoing back to Figure 2, if we look past the top six or so Christmas hymns, we get to what appears to be a second tier of popularity. This tier includes Far, Far Away on Judea’s Plains (#212), I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day (#214), Away in a Manger (#206), O Little Town of Bethlehem (#208), It Came upon the Midnight Clear (#207), and With Wondering Awe (#210). These are what I’m calling the “filler” Christmas hymns—they’re ones that are used to fill in remaining slots once the “Beloved” Christmas hymns have all been chosen. They’re ones that probably everyone knows and recognizes, but maybe wouldn’t be upset if they were missed a year. They may also be the ones that are most commonly sung as choir pieces or other special musical numbers, so the congregation has less of a chance to sing them. On average, they’re each sung in around 65% of wards every year.\n\n\nThe “No Other Choice” Christmas hymns\nFinally, we get to the last tier of Christmas hymns, which includes just two: Once in Royal David’s City (#205) and While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks (#211). These are ones that are what I’m calling the “No Other Choice” Christmas hymns. They’re comparatively much less common than the others, being sung in 43% and 32%, respectively, of wards each year. (To put it another way, any one ward will sing them once every 2–3 years.) To people who have experienced a few years’ worth of sacrament meetings, it’s probably not too much of a surprise to see these so low on the list. I suspect that they’re relatively few music coordinators’ first choices when planning December sacrament meetings and they get incorporated into the month only because most or all of the “Beloved” and “Filler” ones have been taken care of. Or because of a conscious decision to include it because they’re unusual. Or because they’re the Charlie Brown trees of Christmas hymns: they’re included out of pity. I don’t know. For whatever reason, these two hymns are the least popular by a long shot, and you’re likely to sing each of the other Christmas hymns almost twice as often as these two."

Which ones are most common in December?\nI’ve written about sacrament hymns already and there I showed that I Stand All Amazed (#193) is the most common sacrament hymn and the most common hymn overall. However, if we just look at December (Figure 4), we can see that Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (#196) is far and away the most common sacrament hymn in December. None of the others even come close. 55% the wards I have data from sang it during December, which is impressive given that there are four or five chances to sing it and 28 sacrament hymns to choose from. It’s 3.48 times more likely to be sung in December than in any other month of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Sacrament hymns during Christmas time\n\n\n\n\nThe second that appears to stand out is God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son (#187). It’s a trailing second place, so not even close to being the most common. But, it’s sung in 28% of wards I have data from and it’s 1.89 times more common in December than in any other month.

    "text": "Non-Christmas hymns in December\nIt’s true that Decembers are completely dominated by Christmas hymns. Of the 6137 hymns in my database that were sung in December, 58.9% of them were Christmas hymns. Sacrament hymns are another 29.7%, which makes sense since one in every three to four hymns is most likely going to be a sacrament hymn. New Year’s and Thanksgiving hymns make up a small chunk of the data. But, the rest then—8.2% of the hymns in December—are other miscellaneous hymns. That means about one, maybe two, hymns in all of December won’t be holiday- or sacrament-themed.\nLooking at those 8.2% of hymns that are sung in December but aren’t otherwise accounted for, I don’t really see any patterns. Figure 5 shows these most common hymns and all I see are hymns that are just popular at any time of the year. The most common is I Believe in Christ (#134) but it’s not clear to be why it would be so. It’s not terribly common: only about 9% of wards sing it in December, so you might sing it in your ward in December once a decade or so.Interestingly, my ward did a Christmas testimony Sunday this year, where people got up and talked about their favorite Christmas hymn and then we sang one verse of it as a congregation. The only non-Christmas hymn that was selected was I Believe in Christ (#134) and it was by a primary-aged boy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Non-Christmas hymns during Christmas time\n\n\n\n\nI’m trying to think of reasons for singing a non-holiday hymn in December. I suppose a missionary farewell or homecoming might mean the ward sings a missionary work–related hymn. In my homeward, we sang Joseph Smith’s First Prayer (#26) or Praise to the Man (#27) just before Christmas to celebrate Joseph Smith’s birthday on December 23rd. It looks like that’s not a common practice. Or, I’ve heard of wards on the last Sunday of December singing something vaguely looking towards the future like Go Forth with Faith (#263) or something that closes the year like Now the Day Is Over (#159), but it doesn’t appear to be common enough to surface here. Or maybe the music coordinator is just sick of Christmas hymns.I’ll soon post an analysis of the last Sunday in December.\nIt should be noted though that not all weeks in December are treated equally. Figure 6 breaks the data down into the first, second, third, fourth, and (if applicable) fifth Sundays of December, with the hymns grouped by category (Sacrament, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s, and “other”).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Category of hymns by week in December\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a lot of interesting things to say based on this plot.\n\nFirst, we see the the proportion of sacrament hymns is pretty constant at around 30% of the data, with a little more on the first Sunday of the month since that’s usually Fast and Testimony meeting and there is typically not an intermediate hymn.\nThe traditional Thanksgiving hymns (i.e. hymns 91–95) are pretty much non-existent in December and the only reason we see some “Thanksgiving” category on the fifth Sunday of December is because it’s Count Your Blessings (#241) and Because I Have Been Given Much (#219). They’re hymns that are generally common but peak during Thanksgiving so I count them as Thanksgiving hymns.\nThe proportion of Christmas hymns hit their greatest concentration during the second and third weeks of December, accounting for about 65% of the hymns sung during those weeks. These are peak Christmas weeks and it would be rather unusual to sing anything else.\nThe New Year’s hymns are quite common on the last week of the month, especially if it’s a fifth Sunday. Given that there are only two hymns in that category (#215 and #217), it’s impressive they make up such a large proportion of the data.\nFinally, all the other hymns. There is a clear U-shaped pattern, where singing non-holiday hymns is gets less and less common as you approach Christmas. But during the last Sunday of the month, especially if it’s a fifth Sunday, the proportion of “other” hymns goes up quite a bit.\n\nSo, even though just 8.2% of the hymns sung in December are non-holiday hymns, that is mostly found in the last week of the month."

We’ll exclude the last week of Noveber because many wards start singing them then. We’ll also exclude the first Sunday of January since we occasionally get some then too. Once we do that, Christmas hymns are extremely uncommon. They only happened 41 times out of the 57,153 hymns outside of the Christmas season, or just 0.072% of the time. The majority of them are in mid-November and a few are as late as mid-January. As far as the rest, I have no explanation whatsoever."

    "text": "Trends within December\nUp above, we saw that not all Sundays in December are equal and that we are most likely to sing Christmas hymns during the second and third Sundays of the month. Previously, when looking at the Sunday after Thanksgiving, I showed that if Thanksgiving is late in the month and the Sunday after Thanksgiving is December 1st, tons of wards sing Christmas hymns than any other Sunday after Thanksgiving. More specifically, the two that entirely drove that trend were Joy to the World (#201) and Oh, Come, All Ye Faithful (#202), rather than just all Christmas hymns being equally common. Given that some hymns are traditionally Advent hymns—meaning they’d come before Christmas day—and others are Christmas hymns—meaning they’d come after—it should be no surprise that different hymns peak in popularity at different times of the month. Let’s look at those patterns now.\nFigure 7 shows how popular each Christmas hymn is by date, going from the fourth Sunday before Christmas to the first Sunday on or after Christmas. The numbers in for each hymn add up to 100%, so for example, out of all the times that Joy to the World (#201) is sung, 30% of the time it’s December 18th–24th.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Popularity of Christmas hymns by date in the Christmas season\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lot to unpack here, so let’s look at what’s going on. First, we see that few hymns peak the Sunday before Christmas, meaning they’re most commonly sung then. Silent Night (#204) has the biggest peak, not only of this group, but of any hymns across any week. 40% of the time that this hymn is sung, it’s done so the Sunday before Christmas. No other hymn is quite so concentrated as that. Two other hymns also peak the Sunday before Christmas though, Joy to the World (#201) with another pretty strong peak at 31.6% and O, Come, All Ye Faithful (#202) at 26.2%. It is probably not a coincidence that these three are also among the most “beloved” Christmas hymns. Perhaps another way of thinking of it is that music coordinators save the “best” hymns for the “best” Sunday.\nThe most number of hymns appear to peak two Sundays before Christmas, sometime between December 11th and December 17th. These include Angels We Have Heard on High (#203), Once in Royal David’s City (#205), Away in a Manger (#206), It Came upon the Midnight Clear (#207), O Little Town of Bethlehem (#208), Hark! the Herald Angels Sing (#209), and The First noel (#213). It’s probably not a coincidence that this list includes the remaining “beloved” hymns as well as many of the “filler” Christmas hymns described above.\nTwo hymns peak the third Sunday before Christmas, or rather, between December 4th and 10th. They are While Shepherds Watch their Flocks (#211) and Far, Far Away on Judea’s Plains (#212). Technically, With Wondering Awe (#210) also peaks the third Sunday before Christmas, but the real pattern with that hymns is that its popularity is level: it’s more or less equally likely to be sung during any week of Christmas.\nFinally, we have I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day (#214), which is the only on that peaks the Sunday after Christmas. This makes sense, given that the title is in the past tense, implying that Christmas day has already happened.\nOverall, while the pattern is not perfect, there appears to be a trend of singing the most popular Christmas hymns closer to Christmas. It’s not clear to me whether they were popular first, so they get sung then, or if they’re sung then and that’s what made them popular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother look at the data\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way of looking at this data is to basically change it so that instead of the numbers for each hymn adding up to 100%, the numbers within each week at up to 100%. Figure 8 shows that. It’s largely the same as Figure 7, with a few differences mostly in the first and last weeks because Christmas hymns are less popular then so there’s a smaller sample size. I won’t go in to detail here, but feel free to look through this chart.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Popularity of Christmas hymns by date in the Christmas season\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething I noticed was the patterns for Joy to the World (#201) and O Come, All Ye Faithful (#202) here to what I showed when I did a deep dive on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. Those two hymns had a very obvious spike the Sunday after Thanksgiving—but only if that Sunday fell on December 1st. However, looking at those two hymns’ patterns across the entire Christmas season, we see a relatively small proportion of when those hymns are sung is that early in the season. They’re both more common the Sunday before Thanksgiving. So, why the spike on December 1st? I can’t help but think that music coordinators simply choose those two on December 1st simply because they the first two listed in the hymnal! I wonder if, when we get the next hymnal, if they’ll be ordered the same way; if not, we might see that whatever hymns are listed early get sung earlier in the season. We’ll have to wait and see."

    "text": "Opening, Intermediate, and Closing hymns\nFinally, let’s look at what happens within meetings themselves. Which Christmas hymns are most likely to be sung as opening hymns, closing hymns, and intermediate hymns? Figure 9 shows the 14 Christmas hymns and, for each one, what percent of the time they’re opening, intermediate, or closing hymns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Christmas hymns and when they’re sung in sacrament meeting\n\n\n\n\nOverall there are fewer intermediate hymns around Christmas time (because there are presumably more special musical numbers), so it shouldn’t be a surprise that the bars representing the intermediate hymns are lower for all 14 Christmas hymns. But there should be equal or very close to equal numbers of opening and closing hymns. Assuming Christmas hymns were randomly chosen, we’d expect the bars representing the opening and closing hymns to be a the same height. But, for relatively few hymns do we see that pattern. Instead, we see that most hymns lean more towards being opening hymns verses closing hymns. The standout is Silent Night (#203), which is sung as the closing hymn 76% of the times it’s sung.\nLet’s look at the same data but organized differently. Figure 10 shows the hymns in order of how often they were sung as opening hymns. Here we can see that the most quintessential opening hymn is Oh, Come, All Ye Faithful (#202), which is sung as an opening hymn 63% of the time that it’s sung. In fact, we see that many of the most common Christmas hymns are near the top of the list. Again, I can’t help but notice that the first three Christmas hymns listed in the hymnal (#201, #202, and #203) are the most common opening hymns, making me wonder whether there is a bit of a trend to sing the hymns in order of appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Opening hymns during Christmas\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll jump to the closing hymn chart, Figure 11, because it looks more or less like the opposite of Figure 10. Here, we see Silent Night (#204) at the top of the list like we saw above. What was surprising to me though was to see The First Noel (#213), Away in a Manger (#206), and O Little Town of Bethlehem (#208) near the top, all being sung as closing hymns more than half the time they’re sung.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Closing hymns during Christmas\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we get to Figure 12, which shows intermediate hymns. This to me was one of the biggest surprises of this whole blog post: the least common sacrament hymns are most commonly sung as intermediate hymns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Intermediate hymns during Christmas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStats for nerds :)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is actually a pretty strong correlation between the overall frequency of a Christmas hymn and the proportion of the time that hymn is sung as an intermediate hymn. Figure 13 shows the relationship between these two. The correlation is -0.904.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Correlation between overall frequency and frequency of being an intermediate hymn\n\n\n\n\nAnd just to show that this not a spurious correlation, here’s the same plot but for opening hymns and closing hymns. The correlations are, respectively, 0.442 and -0.100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there’s an inverse relationship between how common a Christmas hymn is and what percentage of the time it’s sung as an intermediate hymn. Specifically, the less common a sacrament hymn is, the more likely it is sung as an intermediate hymn. In more practical terms, we’re again getting a peek into the decision-making process behind the selection of sacrament hymns. In this case, what we’re seeing is that the intermediate hymn slots might be thought of as a “throw-away” slot where the less “beloved” hymns are sung. Perhaps the thought is that you wouldn’t want to start or end a meeting with a less familiar hymn. Or maybe another way of thinking about it is that you do want to start and end meetings in December with the Christmas favorites."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn this post we’ve seen a lot of patterns with Christmas hymns in the Christmas season. First, we looked at the season itself and tried to use the hymns to determine when the Christmas season starts and ends. We saw that the 14 hymns fall under three categories (“beloved”, “filler,” and “no other choice”), based on how common they were, with some of the most common ones being sung sometimes twice in a single Christmas season. Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (#196) is the most common sacrament hymn during the Christmas season and I Believe in Christ (#134) is the most non-Christmas hymn during the Christmas season. Unsurprisingly, Christmas hymns are hardly ever sung outside of the Christmas season. Some hymns are more common the closer it is to Christmas; others are more common a little before that or even after Christmas. Finally, some hymns are preferred for opening hymns, others for closing, and the least common Christmas hymns are most commonly sung as intermediate hymns."

    "text": "But do we actually see G major the most?\nSo we’ve addressed the question of what key signature the most number of hymns are set to. But, does that actually mean that’s the most that we see? What’s the difference? It may be the case that tons of hymns in G major are really obscure ones that hardly anyone ever sees. So, if we take frequency into account, perhaps another key is seen more often, even if fewer hymns are actually in it.\n(An analogy here is that Figure 1 is like the Senate: equal representation of all states, regardless of population. In this case, all hymns are treated equally, regardless of how often they’re sung. Figure 2 is like the House of Representatives: representation based on population, or in this case, how often a hymn is sung.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Frequency of key signatures, weighted based on hymn popularity\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 looks similar to Figure 1 except I’ve adjusted the heights of the bars based on how frequent each hymn is. If a hymn is more common, it’ll raise the bar for its key signature more. If it’s less common, it’ll raise it less.\nWhile superficially the two plots may look similar, there are some important differences. (See Table 1 as well.) First, D major is closer in height to G major. While only about 16.5% of the hymns are in D, they’re sung about 18.3% of the time. This is likely due to some pretty common sacrament hymns like Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (#196), O God, the Eternal Father (#175), and In Memory of the Crucified (#190) as well as some other heavy hitters like I Believe in Christ (#134) and We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (#19).\nMost of the other key signatures are pretty similar. C major and F major are more or less unchanged. Though 11.47% of hymns are set in B♭ major, they’re only sung about 10.34% of the time. And while A♭ major is only used in 5.59% of the hymns, it’s sung 4.85% of the time in sacrament meeting. (No doubt, I Stand All Amazed (#193) is doing the lion’s share of the work there.)\nPerhaps the biggest change is that E♭ is a bit more commonly seen than you’d expect based on how many hymns there are in it. 14.41% of hymns are in E♭, but 16.91% of the hymns actually sung in sacrament meeting are in E♭. Undoubtedly, it’s because nine of the 28 sacrament hymns are in E♭. So, to put it another way, on average, hymns in E♭ major are more common than hymns in C major or even B♭ major.\nFinally, the fact that the keys of A and D♭ major are mere slivers in Figure 2 reflects what was explained above that they’re really uncommon.\nFigure 2 probably has the most useful application out of anything else in this blog post. If you’re a budding musician and are still getting used to key signatures, the good news is that you don’t have to learn all twelve keys to play the hymnal. If you focus your efforts on hymns in G, D, and E♭, you’ll get the most mileage out of your practice.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Key signature frequencies\n\n\nKey Signature\n# of hymns\n% of hymnal\n% of hymns sung\n\n\n\n\nA\n2\n0.59%\n0.14%\n\n\nD\n56\n16.47%\n18.34%\n\n\nG\n76\n22.35%\n21.51%\n\n\nC\n49\n14.41%\n13.97%\n\n\nF\n48\n14.12%\n13.90%\n\n\nBb\n39\n11.47%\n10.34%\n\n\nEb\n49\n14.41%\n16.91%\n\n\nAb\n19\n5.59%\n4.85%\n\n\nDb\n2\n0.59%\n0.03%"

    "section": "Why is G major the most common?",
    "text": "Why is G major the most common?\nI’m not a musicologist, but I can speculate as to why G is more common than C. It may be the case that many melodies are centered around the tonic, and extend roughly a fifth above it and roughly a fourth or fifth below it, with a total range of about an octave. If that’s the case, and a comfortable octave for many singers is from D to D, that means the key of G would be an appropriate key signature. A good example of this is Love One another (#308), in the left panel of Figure 3, which shows the distribution of notes in the melody, with the tonic highlighted in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Soprano ranges for two representative hymns\n\n\n\n\nOther melodies also span a full octave but the highest and lowest notes are the tonic itself. A good example of this is All Creatures of Our God and King (#62), the right panel of Figure 3. For melodies such as these, a key signature like D (or in this case, E♭) would be more appropriate so that the melody does not go too high or too low.\nSo, it may be the case then that the reason why G major is the most common key is because there are more melodies like Love One another (#308) than like All Creatures of Our God and King (#62). (Looking through plots like what you see in Figure 3, but for all the hymns in the key of G, it seems like pretty much all of them look similar to Love One another (#308).)\nAlong similar lines, if a piece is set to the key of G, the basses get to end the piece on a strong low note that many men, particularly men who sing bass lines, can hit. It’s nice to end a piece with the tonic being the lowest note of the bass line, and the entire hymn. Some examples of these hymns include Do What is Right (#237) (shown in the left panel of Figure 4) and God, Our Father, Hear Us Pray (#170). Other hymns, such as those set in C major or B♭ major, have the dominant (or fifth note of the scale) as the lowest note of the bass line, sometimes near the very end of the piece, like in Silent Night (#203) (shown in the right panel of Figure 4) or The Spirit of God (#2). While dropping down to a low dominant (in this case F if it’s in the key of B♭) can be a nice way to close a piece, I think a stronger finish is to end with the lowest note being the dominant, hence the greater number of hymns set in the key of G.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Bass ranges for two representative hymns"

    "text": "What about minor keys?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nExactly five hymns are set in a minor key.\n\n\nYou can see the five hymns in a minor key in Figure 5. The most common is the New Year’s Day hymn, Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215). We’ll talk more about holidays later on, but it’s only sung by 45% of wards around New Year’s Day. The next most common is If You Could Hie to Kolob (#284) although it’s not especially frequent and is only sung about once every 3.1 years or so. Third is That Easter Morn (#198) which, from my intuition, is punching above its weight because only 22% of wards sing it around Easter. The last two, Lord, We Come Before Thee Now (#162) and How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True? (#126) are pretty unusual and are sung about once every 15 years and once every 48 years or so, respectively.Although, if your ward ever does one of those musical testimony meetings where people get up and say what their favorite hymn is and then everyone sings a verse of that, I suspect you’re pretty much guaranteed to sing it then.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Frequency of hymns in a minor key\n\n\n\n\nSo, if you sing a hymn in a minor key, it’s probably one of the two holiday ones or If You Could Hie to Kolob (#284). I can’t help but think that the reason If You Could Hie to Kolob (#284) is so popular is because it’s set in a minor key. It’s a pretty obscure piece of doctrine that it’s talking about and I wonder if it were set to a different tune if it’d be as popular. In other words, do people like it because of the words or because of the music? Also, for what it’s worth, the distribution of notes looks very much like Love One another (#308) (the left panel in Figure 3).In fact, it was set to a different tune, in a major key, in the 1948 hymnal. It’s hymn #257. I don’t know how popular it was prior to 1985 though."

    "section": "What are the Thanksgiving hymns?",
    "text": "What are the Thanksgiving hymns?\nThe Table of Contents in the front of the hymnal doesn’t have a dedicated section for Thanksgiving, but there is a “Praise and Thanksgiving” section, which includes hymns 62–96. In my mind though, the unofficial list of Thanksgiving hymns are hymns 91 through 95. This checks out with the “Thanksgiving” entry in the Topics index. The Topics index also recommends looking at the “Gratitude” entry, which lists an additional 22 hymns. So, the question then is this: what hymns are actually sung around Thanksgiving?\nLet’s take a look at what is sung in November in the United States. Figure 1 shows the hymns that are the most common in November. As expected, the five “Thanksgiving” hymns (hymns 91–95), which are highlighted in red, are on this list. We also see two other hymns that are about gratitude, Count Your Blessings (#241) and Because I Have Been Given Much (#219). Finally we see All Creatures of Our God and King (#62), a hymn that is probably more about praise than gratitude but it fits. So, of the 22 hymns listed in the back of the hymnal under the Gratitude entry, only three of them surface as being sung more in November than in other months.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Most common hymns in November (excluding sacrament hymns)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStats for nerds :)\n\n\n\n\n\nThese eight hymns shown in Figure 1 are not only the most frequent hymns in November generally, but they’re also eight of the nine whose increased frequency in November is statistically significant. For each hymn, I ran a \\(\\chi^2\\) test comparing how often it occurs in November to the other 11 months of the year. A sample table for Come, Ye Thankful People (#94) looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nHymn 94\nAll other hymns\n\n\n\n\nNumber of times sung in November\n243\n5778\n\n\nNumber of times not sung in November\n33\n59243\n\n\n\nThe \\(\\chi^2\\) suggests that the association between Hymn 94 and being sung in November is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 2047.811, df = 1, \\(p\\) &lt; 0.001).\nHowever, I had to do that for all 242 hymns that were ever sung in November in this sample. So, to avoid the potential of false positives when running that many independent tests, I decided to do a Bonferroni correction, so only hymns that had a p-value less than \\(0.001 / 242\\) ≈ 0.00000413 were considered statistically significant. I know Bonferroni is known to be a bit harsh of a penalty, but in this case it seems to work well.\n(I’ll be honest, I’m not sure if \\(\\chi^2\\)-tests should be done with the sample size is so large or if they’re so disproportionate. Please let me know if there’s a different test I could use!)\nWhat is very interesting to me is that one other hymn stood out as being sung statistically significantly more in November than in the rest of the year: Silent Night (#203). Of course it’s sung more in December too. But of all the Christmas hymns, Silent Night (#203) appears to be one to kick off the Christmas season. I’ll do a whole blog post about the Sunday after Thanksgiving and whether people sing Thanksgiving or Christmas hymns then.\n\n\n\nFor what it’s worth, I’ve excluded sacrament hymns in Figure 1 and I will for the rest of this blog post. One reason is because they distract from the real patterns that occur. I Stand All Amazed (#193) was about as common in November as Count Your Blessings (#241) was. Does that mean it’s a Thanksgiving hymn? Probably not. It’s just a really common hymn and it’s likely to be sung any time of the year. Another reason is because no sacrament hymn is sung in November statistically significantly more than you’d expect if they were evenly distributed throughout the year.\nJust to show that the other 19 hymns listed in the “Gratitude” entry in the back of the hymnal were not popular around Thanksgiving, let’s look at how often each of the 27 total hymns we’ve discussed so far are sung throughout the year. Figure 2 shows this data. From left to right (within each panel), we have the first week of the year to the last week of the year. Higher points on the plot mean the hymn was sung more that week. Each of the 22 gratitude and Thanksgiving hymns is in its own panel, in order of hymn number. I’ve put a pink line where Thanksgiving typically falls in the year to give a point of reference.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Annual trends of 27 gratitude and Thanksgiving hymns\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 makes it pretty clear that hymns 91–95 really are mostly sung in November and really not very often outside of November. The others that made the cut as being Thanksgiving hymns have a burst of currency in November, but not quite as large. All Creatures of Our God and King (#62) is also common around Easter and Because I Have Been Given Much (#219) and Count Your Blessings (#241) are common all year but especially in November. All the other hymns in Figure 2 either peak at other times of the year (the topic of which will be the subject of later blog posts) and/or have no apparent jump in frequency in November whatsoever.\nLooking at this plot, I’ll speculate a little bit about what goes on in music coordinators’ heads as they decide what hymns to sing. If they’re familiar with the hymnal already, they may knows that hymns 91–95 are Thanksgiving hymns. They choose one of those, except maybe Father, They Children to Thee Now Raise (#91) because it’s unfamiliar, too difficult to play for the organist, or some other reason. If they think outside the box, they draw on one or more other well-known hymns (All Creatures of Our God and King (#62), Because I Have Been Given Much (#219), and Count Your Blessings (#241)) to fill out their November. If the music coordinator is not as familiar with the hymnal, they may turn to the Topics Index and see hymns 91–95 in the Thanksgiving entry, and go from there. It appears that very few people turn to the “Gratitude” section of the hymnal. Again, this is purely speculation; I have never been a music coordinator, so I’ve never been in a position to regularly choose hymns. But if more people did use these other 19 hymns, we should see more of these hymns being sung in November.\nI’ll end this section with an observation that We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (#19) has not been mentioned at all. It does not come out as being more common in November and it is not listed in the Gratitude or Thanksgiving entries in the topics index at the back of the hymnal. I’ve already shared my feelings about this hymn when I talked about General Conference hymns how it should be thought of as a hymns of praise and thanksgiving rather than a hymn about prophets. Again, changing the title to, simply, “We Thank Thee, O God,” might draw people’s attention away from the first line and more to the overall theme. Figure 3 here shows the popularity of We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (#19) over the year and you can see that it’s no more popular in November than it is in some other random month like June.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Frequency of “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet” over the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation to music coordinators\n\n\n\nTry singing We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (#19) right before Thanksgiving!"

    "text": "How many Thanksgiving hymns do wards sing in November?\nGoing back to Figure 1, we see that Come, Ye Thankful People (#94) is sung in about 73.3% of wards as a congregational hymn at least some time during the month of November. Prayer of Thanksgiving (#93) is about 67.8% and For the Beauty of the Earth (#93) is (60.6%). This interpretation works because most wards sing these hymns more more than once a year, and they’re unlikely to repeat the hymn within the month of November. When I first saw these numbers, I actually thought they were a little low. I figured pretty much every ward in the US would sing some of these hymns. I guess not everyone sings Thanksgiving hymns around Thanksgiving!\nSo the question then is this: how many wards sing at least one of these five (or eight) Thanksgiving songs in November? For this question, I’ll only draw from the wards that have contributed data from the entire month of November for a given year. I currently have 206 Novembers worth of data from 110 different wards.\nFocusing on the five prototypical Thanksgiving hymns (hymns 91–95), Figure 4 shows how many of them a ward is likely to sing in November. The most common scenario (a little less than a third of the wards) is that only two of them are sung. But, a fair number of wards sing three or four of them. Less common is one or even all five. To my surprise, 11.7% of wards in the US don’t sing any of these Thanksgiving hymns in November. But that means that 88.3% of wards do, which is a lot. And, yes, there were two wards that had more than five. One ward in 2016 sang Now Thank We All Our God (#95) as the closing hymn two weeks in a row. Another ward sang For the Beauty of the Earth (#92) three times in four weeks in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: How many canonical Thanksgiving hymns does a ward sing in November?\n\n\n\n\nLet’s do the exact same thing, but include the three “honorary mention” Thanksgiving hymns (All Creatures of Our God and King (#62), Because I Have Been Given Much (#219), and Count Your Blessings (#241)) into the mix. Figure 5 shows that data. Again, singing just two of these eight is the most common possibility, but odds are perhaps two wards in your stake will sing three, maybe 1 or 2 will sing four, and maybe one ward in your stake will sing five of them. A few especially thankful wards sang six or seven of them. And still, to my surprise, 6.8% of wards didn’t sing any of these eight hymns in the month of November at all. But, on the flip side, 93.2% of wards sing at least one of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: How many canonical Thanksgiving hymns does a ward sing in November?"

    "text": "Patterns within the Thanksgiving “season”\nNow that we’ve seen what hymns are considered Thanksgiving hymns and how many are sung each year in a ward, let’s dive a little deeper into November and see if we can uncover some more patterns.\nFigure 6 below shows the within-November trends for each of these eight Thanksgiving hymns. This is basically Figure 2 above but zoomed in to just show four weeks and just these eight hymns. There are a few small changes though. First, rather than group the data by week of the year, I’ve grouped the data by the number of Sundays leading up to Thanksgiving. So, the Sunday before Thanksgiving would be 1, the second Sunday before Thanksgiving, would be 2, and so on. The Sunday after Thanksgiving (which will be treated separately in its own blog post) is a 0. Second, rather than show the raw count of how many wards have sung that hymn (which is an arbitrary number dependent on how much data I have), I’ve shown what percentage of the time that particular hymn is sung per week. In other words, the totals within each panel of Figure 6 add up to 100%.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The eight Thanksgiving hymns and when they’re sung in November\n\n\n\n\nIn this figure, we can see some pretty interesting trends. First off, each of these eight hymns were sung by at least one ward in each month of November. In other words, there are no gaps in the data. Second, we see that almost all hymns peak the Sunday before Thanksgiving. This is especially true of the more popular hymns (hymns 92–95), but also applies to 91 and 219. In two cases, All Creates of Our God and King (#62) and Count Your Blessings (#241), we don’t see a spike. Instead, they’re equally likely whether it be two weeks before Thanksgiving, the Sunday right before, or the Sunday after.\nThe issue with this plot is that there’s a confounding factor: how likely Thanksgiving hymns are sung within November. The reason why most of the hymns spike the Sunday before Thanksgiving is simply because that’s when Thanksgiving hymns are most likely to be sung. Figure 7 shows what percentage of US wards sing at least one Thanksgiving hymn by week leading up to Thanksgiving. Unsurprisingly, the Sunday before Thanksgiving is the most common time to sing any of these hymns. So, it makes sense then that, for any Thanksgiving hymn, the most common week to sing it is the Sunday before Thanksgiving.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Percentage of wards that sing at least one Thanksgiving hymn by week\n\n\n\n\nSo, perhaps a better way to look at the data is to change the percentages. Figure 8 shows the same data as Figure 6, but instead of the data within each panel adding up to 100%, the data within each week (4 weeks before, 3 weeks before, etc) add up to 100% across all eight panels. So, the way you interpret this is that given all the Thanksgiving hymns sung, for example, four weeks before Thanksgiving, a quarter of them will be Because I Have Been Given Much (#219). Given all the Thanksgiving hymns the Sunday before Thanksgiving, about a quarter of them will be Prayer of Thanksgiving (#93). So, the higher a number is on any one of these panels, the more typical it is for it to be sung that week.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: The eight Thanksgiving hymns and the likihood of being sung across November weeks.\n\n\n\n\nSo here, we see some, in my opinion, more interesting trends. Some hymns, like Because I Have Been Given Much (#219) and For the Beauty of the Earth (#92), are more popular further from Thanksgiving, and get less popular leading up to it.  Other hymns are more common the closer it is to Thanksgiving.To be clear, the raw numbers in Figure 6 show an increase through the month, but here we’re focused on how often a hymn is selected, given that it’s one of these eight hymns being sung, per week. I don’t know, I think this plot shows a more accurate picture of my intuition.\nThis chart reveals some additional insight into how music coordinators choose hymns. You’re not likely to sing any one of these Thanksgiving hymns more than once in the Thanksgiving “season.” So, the music coordinator is left to decide which hymns to choose and when to sing them during the month. We already saw in Figure 7 that these hymns are more common the closer it is to Thanksgiving and that most wards sing maybe 2–4 of these. So, let’s say a ward ends up with four of them. Well they can’t sing them all in one week, so one of them will be pushed to the week prior. Which hymn does the music coordinator choose? I think what people think is that they don’t want to “waste” the “good” hymn on an earlier week. Or rather, they save the “best” hymns for the preferred weeks. So, the “throwaway” hymns like Because I Have Been Given Much (#219), Count Your Blessings (#241), or even Father, Thy Children to Thee Now Raise (#91) are sung in the nonideal weeks, and ones like Prayer of Thanksgiving (#93) and Come, Ye Thankful People (#94) are reserved for the best week. As we’ll see in later blog posts, this is a recurring pattern for many holidays.\nI think these patterns feed into each other. How does a music coordinator know which hymns are “best”? Experience in the church and general intuition is helpful, I think words like Thanksgiving and Thankful that line up with the name of the holiday are almost guarenteed to make them quintessential. Imagine if there were a hymn that had the word “Valentine” in it, I think it’d be sung the week before Valentine’s Day a lot had hardly ever any other week! So when a hymn becomes strongly associated with a holiday, they’re likely to sing it the week prior to that holiday and not choose it any other week of the year, which is what we see in Figure 2 with the annual trends for all hymns. The less quintessential ones are more flexible.\nAnother potential factor that I haven’t mentioned at all is that there is more to a sacrament meeting besides when in the year it happens. The topic of a particular sacrament meeting can often have a strong effect on what hymns are being sung. If topics are more or less random across wards, the topic-specific effects will cancel each other out. However, topics are often chosen based on proximity to holidays, and while I don’t have the data to show this, I would suspect that many sacrament meetings in November are on the topic of Gratitude. So, especially earlier in the month when Thanksgiving itself is less on people’s minds, a more general gratitude-related hymn is selected. But, the point I’m trying to make is that both sacrament meeting topics and hymns are often chosen because of holidays and they mutually reinforce each other to create these November-specific patterns discussed on this page."

Are these hymns likely to be sung as opening hymns, intermediate hymns, or closing hymns? Figure 9 shows the eight Thanksgiving hymns and how often they occured within sacrament meeting. The totals in each panel add up to 100%.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: When each Thanksgiving hymn is sung within sacrament meeting.\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like each hymn has its own story. Some hymns are most often sung as opening hymns, like All Creates of Our God and King (#62), Father, Thy Children to Thee Now Raise (#91), Prayer of Thanksgiving (#93), and Come, Ye Thankful People (#94). Just one, Now Thank We All Our God (#95) is most common as a closing hymn; it’s not clear to me why that hymn shows that pattern. Others like For the Beauty of the Earth (#92) and Because I Have Been Given Much (#219) are equally split between bing opening hymns and closing hymns. Finally, Count Your Blessings (#241) is equally split between being opening and intermediate hymns, but is less likely to be a closing hymn. It seems like the most “Thanksgivingy” hymns are less likely to be intermediate hymns. But, I have no idea why these hymns show these patterns and I’m very curious to figure them out! It seems there is more to hymn selection than what can be explained in this dataset!"

The majority of wards sing between two and four of these hymns per year, but some sing as many as seven and others sing none at all. The Thanksgiving season starts in November and you’re more likely to sing Thanksgiving hymns the closer you are to the holiday itself. The most “Thanksgivingy” hymns are most likely right before Thanksgiving. Some hymns are more commonly sung as opening hymns, but other hymns have their own patterns. Clearly, there is a lot that can be uncovered by just looking at hymns in November!"

With this music now reduced down to numbers, I can analyze it quantitatively. This post is the first of many that will present a numeric analysis of the music of the hymns themselves. I’ve started with the soprano line since it’s what is most familiar to most people, but I’ll eventually do similar posts on alto, tenor, and bass lines as well."

    "text": "Highest melody notes\nThe first question we can ask is this: what is the highest note a melody goes up to?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe highest (non-optional) melody note is an F♯5, which is found in Lean on My Ample Arm (120).\n\n\nThat of course excludes the optional G5 at the end of Carry On (255). What’s worse about the the F♯5 in Lean on My Ample Arm (120) is that it’s a sustained note—there’s nowhere to hide! However, it is very unlikely that you’ll sing it in church. In all the data I have, it was only sung four times, which means it’s sung about once every 29 years. Another way of putting it is that the hymn is sung in sacrament meeting about once a generation. So, if you can’t quite reach that F♯5, don’t worry because you will likely never need to.For what it’s worth, a combined choir from BYU sang it in General Conference in April 2008 and it was beautiful.\nWell then, what is a typical highest note for a soprano line?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe majority of hymns have D5 as their highest note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighest Note\nNumber of Hymns\nPercentage of Hymnal\n\n\n\n\nAb4\n2\n0.61%\n\n\nBb4\n1\n0.31%\n\n\nB4\n2\n0.61%\n\n\nC5\n30\n9.17%\n\n\nC#5\n6\n1.83%\n\n\nD5\n164\n50.15%\n\n\nEb5\n62\n18.96%\n\n\nE5\n54\n16.51%\n\n\nF5\n5\n1.53%\n\n\nF#5\n1\n0.31%\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are another five hymns that have melody lines that go up to an F5. But, as seen below, the only one that is moderately common is The Morning Breaks (1). The others are sung so infrequently, that their presence in sacrament meetings is negligible. Great Is the Lord (77) was sung just four times in my sample and both The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37) and Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (118) were each sung only twice. And Sweet Is the Work (317) is a women’s choir arrangement so, as I’ve discussed already, it’s not sung very much.\n\nHymns with melodies that go up to an F5\n\n\nHymn\nHow often it’s sung\n\n\n\n\nThe Morning Breaks (1)\nOnce every 3.5 years\n\n\nGreat Is the Lord (77)\nOnce every 30 years\n\n\nThe Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37)\nOnce every 60 years\n\n\nYe Simple Souls Who Stray (118)\nOnce every 60 years\n\n\nSweet Is the Work (317)\nNever?\n\n\n\nSo, six of the 341 hymns on our current hymnal go up to an F5 or F♯5, which is 1.76% of the hymnal. If all hymns were sung equally often as each other, we’d then expect that 1.76% of sacrament meeting hymns to go up to an F5 or F♯5. In reality, only 0.24% of them do, which means these six hymns are less common than expected. On average, you’ll encounter one maybe once every two and a half years. And if you do, three-quarters of the time it’ll be The Morning Breaks (1).\nI can’t help but wonder whether that high melody note is the reason these hymns are so uncommon. It may be the case that they are unusual hymns anyway that for whatever reason are not sung very often. But I think that these hymns are uncommon at least partially because of these high notes. A music coordinator might consider selecting one of these for their ward to sing in sacrament meeting, but for the sake of everyone’s voices, ultimately decides against it. Thus, the high note perpetuates the rarity of the hymn. We saw this with the key signatures as well: hymns with marginally-attested phenomena (in this case, the keys of A and Db) are rarer than they would be due to chance alone."

There are only 6 that go up to a C♯ or D♭, including Because I Have Been Given Much (219). The figure below shows all of them and how often they occur. It’s interesting that even though there are six hymns that fall into this category, two are sacrament hymns and one is a very common one. So even though they make up just 1.76% of the hymnal, they make up about 2.65% of the hymns sung in church. You’re likely to see one every 11 or so weeks on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think there are relatively few that have this particular note simply because of what key signatures are most common. It’s probably not a coincidence that one of the two hymns in D♭ are in this category. Most of the others are in A♭. If there were more hymns in D♭ major, or even A♭ we might see more hymns where the highest note is D♭5.\nAnother 30 hymns only go as high as a C5, including Choose the Right (239) and Come, Follow Me (116). They make up 8.8% of the hymnal but 11.7% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are five hymns don’t ever go higher than the middle of the treble clef. The two that only go to a B4 are both pretty well known: Secret Prayer (144) and Lead, Kindly Light (197). The only one that has B♭4 as the highest note is for men, Ye Who Are Called to Labor (321), so it might not even count as a “soprano” note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe lowest highest melody note is an A♭4, which is found in the rare God Moves in a Mysterious Way (285) and the extremely rare Now the Day is Over (159).\n\n\nThese two hymns are low enough that even a good tenor could sing the melody in the right octave! In total, there are just five hymns that don’t reach a C5, which is only 1.5% of the hymnal. And they’re rarer hymns, so they only make up 0.72% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting. So, if your highest note is a B, you might be able to sing melody once every 10 months or so. At least these lower hymns are more common that the hymns that go up to an F5 or F♯5!"

So, if I were in charge, I’d selfishly transpose many of these hymns down a bit so that their highest note is in a more comfortable range for me.

I’ve color-coded the hymn names to correspond to the holiday they are most closely associated with. Hymns 201–214 are Christmas hymns and are colored in red. Hymns 215 and 217 are New Year’s hymns and are colored in blue. Everything else is colored in gray.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Most popular congregational hymns the two Sundays after Christmas\n\n\n\n\nIt’s apparent that it is quite popular to sung New Year’s hymns the Sunday after Christmas. Almost 50% of wards sing Come, Let Us Anew (#217) and about 44% sing Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215). There is also a clear stand out for the most most popular Christmas hymn during this week, which is I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day (#215), but only about 17% of wards sing it the Sunday after Christmas.\nWhat is interesting is that We Are Sowing (#216) made it on this chart. It’s not a New Year’s hymn (it’s not listed as one in topics index), but it is, for some reason, sandwiched between the two that are. What seems like is happening is that it gets lumped in by association. Unsurprising, but pretty interesting that it happens enough to show up on the plot.\nBut, you might argue that the week after Christmas is a totally different Sunday than the week after New Year’s. And you’d be right! If we break the data down into those two weeks, we get very different pictures! @fig_limbo shows the most popular hymns just in the last week of December. You can see that while the New Year’s hymns are still at the top, all the rest are all Christmas hymns. And if you look closely, Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215) is the more common of the two New Year’s hymns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Most popular congregational hymns December 26th–31st\n\n\n\n\nIf we now look at the first Sunday in January, we get a totally different picture. Figure 3 shows that once we’re on the January side of New Year’s, no Christmas hymn is popular. We again get the New Year’s hymns, but all the other hymns are just generic popular hymns without much of a theme.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Most popular congregational hymns January 1st–7th\n\n\n\n\nSo, while this blog post is intending to cover both of these weeks at the same time, it’s important to separate them out as best I can."

Here’s a (maybe confusing) summary of what’s happening:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nAbout half of the wards sing Christmas hymns and half don’t.

Of the ones that do, about a third also sing Christmas hymns. Of the one’s that don’t, about a third also do not sing Christmas hymns.\n\n\nI find the symmetry in those results very satisfying.\nI took a look at the wards that didn’t sing either Christmas or New Year’s hymns the last week of December and I didn’t see too much about what hymns they did sing. There were a few that I could see fitting with the theme of the closing of a year, like God Be With You Till We Meet Again (#152), The Time is Far Spent (#266), The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37), Sing We Now at Parting (#156), Lord, Dismiss Us with Thy Blessing (#163), Lord, We Ask Thee Ere We Part (#153), and Now the Day Is Over (#159). Another theme was people choosing “forward looking” hymns like Go Forth with Faith (#263), Let Us All Press On (#243), Onward, Christian Soldiers (#246), Put Your Shoulder to the Wheel (#252). Personally, I appreciate the thought behind the selection of these hymns. Unfortunately, they are just not common enough to show up on any of these plots.\nThe other pattern, singing both a Christmas hymn and a New Year’s hymn, is just as common as singing neither. Like what we saw for the week after Thanksgiving, there does seem to be a pattern though for when within the meeting these Christmas and New Year’s hymns are sung. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most common configuration is for the opening hymn to be a Christmas hymn and the closing hymn to be a New Year’s hymn. That happened in 90% of the wards I have data from that sang both hymn types in the same meeting. Of those, the most sang some other hymn as the intermediate hymn, then Christmas, then New Year’s. The other configurations I have attestations of are shown in Table 2 and only showed up once or twice.

    "text": "New Year’s Day\nLike what we saw with the Sunday after Thanksgiving, there is an effect that the actual date has on the hymns. Specifically, if that Sunday lands on December 1st, the numnber of Christmas hymns goes up quite a bit. Do we see the same kind of pattern with New Year’s Day?\nProbably unsurprisingly, yes! Figure 4 shows the breakdown of Christmas, New Year’s and other hymns from December 26th through January 7th.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Proportion of Christmas, New Year’s, and Other hymns by date\n\n\n\n\nI think this is a largely unsurprising pattern. First, we see that the number of Christmas hymns decreases the further you get from Christmas. In secular American Christmas culture, it seems like the Christmas season ends sometime between Christmas and New Year’s. However, in some Christian traditions, they do honor the fact that the “twelve days of Christmas” starts on Christmas day, meaning it extends until January 5th, with various celebrations happening after that, like Epiphany on the 6th. In my experience (keeping mind that I’m not an expert in Mormon culture), the end of the Christmas season for Latter-day Saints is in-line with mainstream American culture and happens pretty soon after the 25th. This plot shows pretty strong evidence for that: there was no indication of Christmas hymns being sung during the last three days of Christmas.\nThe second pattern we see is the rise and fall of the popularity of New Year’s hymns. The closer you are to New Year’s Eve—and yes, it appears to peak on New Year’s Eve—the more likely you are to sing New Year’s hymns.\nFinally, all the other hymns gradually become more common as you progress from December 26th to January 7th. It’s actually quite a straight line, so there doesn’t appear to be a jump at any one point.\nSo, when looking at the transition from Thanksgiving to Christmas, there was an abrupt pivot point at December 1st. In this case, there is no such abrupt change. Instead, we gradually transition away from Christmas, into New Year’s, and away from both over the course of two weeks. I think this is quite a cool pattern to see because, as far as I’m aware, this is almost entirely unconscious. I don’t think any music coordinator looks at their notes from previous years and thinks, “well, this year, we’re one day further to New Year’s than we were last year, so I’ll lower the odds of choosing a New Year’s hymn by 5%.” But, when aggregating many wards over many years, the pattern is pretty tidy.\nI should mention that seeing the trend shown in Figure 4 is only possible because I have data spanning over 20 years. Since the the Sundays around New Year’s Day fall on different dates, I can compare those days to each other. So, for example, in 2024, New Year’s Day will be on a Monday, so Sunday will be New Year’s Eve. This was also true in 2007 and 2018, so that column represents those three years pooled together. I think this is important to mention because no matter how much data is collected from one year, you’ll still only see just one of these columns. It takes a lot of data over many years to be able to see this kind of nuance.\nTo dig just a little deeper, I wanted to see the trends for specific hymns across these dates. In Figure 5 (sorry for the small text), each of the 14 Christmas hymns and two New Year’s Hymns is in their own panel. Lines and dots are higher if that hymn is sung more often on that day.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Christmas and New Year’s hymn frequencies, Dec 26 through Jan 7\n\n\n\n\nAmong the New Year’s hymns, we again see that Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215) is more common in December and that Come, Let Us Anew (#217) is more common in January. Among the Christmas hymns, there’s nothing that really stands out. Each hymn has its own story of course, but it’s nothing that we haven’t already seen when looking at Christmas hymns over the course of December.A \\(\\chi^2\\) test suggests that this difference—that Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215) is more common before New Year’s and Come, Let Us Anew (#217) is more common after—is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 8.78, df = 1, p = 0.002). This may be another case where the order that they appear in the hymnal influences when they’re sung.\nFinally, just to dig a even deeper, Figure 6 shows when the two New Year’s hymns are sung within Sacrament meeting. Because intermediate hymns are not common, it’s no surprise that their bars are smaller. And it’s highly unusual to sing these as sacrament hymns, but apparently it has been done.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: When New Year’s hymns are sung in Sacrament meeting\n\n\n\n\nI’ve split the data up by month because I thought there might be a difference, and it turns out I was right. Come, Let Us Anew (#217) is about equally likely to be sung as an opening hymn or a closing hymn, regardless of whether it’s before New Year’s or after, with maybe a slight preference for it as an opening hymn in January. But Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215) is far more common as a closing hymn in December and as an opening hymn in January.  I think the general idea is that New Year’s hymns are most common in the slot closest to New Year’s itself, so since closing hymns in December are closer to New Year’s, you sing them last, and since opening hymns are closer in January, you sing them as opening hymns.Once again, a \\(\\chi^2\\) test suggests that this difference in when Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215) is sung in the meeting is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 29.56, df = 1, p &lt; 0.001)."

Specifically, Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215) is more common in December (specifically as a closing hymn) and Come, Let Us Anew (#217) is more common in January. Other hymns gradually become more and more common so that by the time the twelve days of Christmas are over, almost all congregations have transitioned completely away from either holiday."

    "text": "Click below depending on how much data you have to contribute.\n\nSubmit many weeks’ worth of dataSubmit one week’s worth of data\n\n\nHere are the best ways you can help out:\n\nSomeone in your ward likely keeps a spreadsheet that has the past few weeks/months/years of hymns sung in sacrament meeting in your ward. This is typically shared between the music coordinator, chorister(s), organist(s), and a bishopric member. If you or someone close to you has access to that spreadsheet, you can simply send a copy to me. This is probably the best way to contribute to this project.\nIf you have a collection of old sacrament meeting programs from your ward, either digital or physical, those usually list the hymns that were sung that week. (I know hardly anyone carries physical scriptures anymore, but look through those to see if there are any old ones tucked away in there!) You can either write down the information from those programs onto a new spreadsheet or document and send me that, or just send me copies of the programs themselves.\nReturn to this page and submit the form every week.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if the sacrament meeting info you send me is recent or not. One ward sent me information from 2003! It also doesn’t matter if there are gaps in your contribution. So if you have data from 2018 and then more from 2023 but missed the years in between, that’s totally fine!\nIf you contribute at least year’s worth of sacrament meetings, I’ll be able to run some stats on your ward, like how varied your hymns are or how unusual they are, compared to other wards. But, any amount of data helps—even if it’s just from a single week or two!\nAgain, email whatever contributions you have to hymnstats@gmail.com and I’ll incorporate it into the analysis as quickly as I can!"

The purpose of this project is to discover what hymns are most commonly sung generally and in certain times of the year in sacrament meetings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

This site gives some of the more important findings; I am writing a short book that contains more detailed results."

    "text": "Project Overview\nHave you ever wondered what the most common hymn is in sacrament meeting? I can tell you right now: it’s I Stand All Amazed (193) and it’s sung, on average, once every 4.4 months in a given ward. What hymn is least common? Well, that’s a trickier question to answer, but if you ignore the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal, some of the least common hymns in sacrament meeting are Sons of Michael, He Approaches (51), This House We Dedicate to Thee (245), Go, Ye Messengers of Glory (262), and God Save the King (341).\nWhat is the most popular Christmas hymn? It looks like it’s Joy to the World (201). If that matches your intuition, then that’s good news because it’s means I’ve got good data! But, what is the most popular Mother’s Day hymn? Thanksgiving? Valentine’s Day?\nWith this project, I have been able to answer some of these simpler questions, but I’ve also been able to uncover some subtler patterns as well. Like, what Christmas hymns are typically sung the third Sunday in December? (The First Noel (213) might be the most likely.) On the Sunday after Thanksgiving (in the United States), do people sing more Thanksgiving hymns, Christmas hymns, or neither? Are there “unofficial” sacrament hymns that are sung more than any of the “official” ones? What percentage of wards outside of Utah (but still in the US) sing Pioneer Day hymns around Pioneer Day?\nI’ve also uncovered some of what might go through a music coordinator’s head as they select what hymns are to be sung in their ward. It seems like the more popular Christmas hymns are reserved for Sundays when it is anticipated that the most number of people will be in attendance, and the less popular ones are used during peak travel dates. Even though the entry for “Thanksgiving” in topic index in the back of the hymnal directs readers to the “Gratitude” for more hymns, very few people actually use those gratitude-themed hymns around Thanksgiving. Easter hymns trump both General Conference– and Fast Sunday–themed hymns in April, and Fourth of July trumps Fast Sunday hymns.\nFurthermore, I’ve been able to uncover patterns that say something interesting about Mormon culture. For example, Mother’s Day hymns are typically about earthly mothers while Father’s Day hymns are about Heavenly Father. Enough Utahns have relocated to other parts of the US that Pioneer Day may be considered a de facto LDS holiday. And a decent number of wards systematically cycle through the 28 sacrament hymns, sometimes for years without any deviation.\nAs a secondary part of this project, I’m also addressing questions about the music of the hymns. What hymn has the highest melody note? Well, if you exclude the women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal and the optional note at the end of Carry On (255), it’s the F# in the rarely-sung Lean on My Ample Arm (120). What part has the narrowest range? What is the most common key signature? How many hymns could you sing the tenor line for if you can only go up to a Bb? What is the most common final chord? How many hymns don’t end on “do”? How many add9 chords are there in the hymnal?"

    "text": "My name is Joey Stanley and I’ve been working on this project since 2013. It started with one simple question: “What is the most common hymn?” Initially, I sought to answer this question by collecting a year’s worth of data from 1000 wards across the country. A pretty lofty goal, I quickly realized. But I have been able to get enough data to the point where I believe I’ve hit a critical mass and it’s certainly enough to uncover some pretty subtle patterns.\nI am a linguistics professor at BYU, which means I am not a statistician or musicologist, though I do have some training in both statistics and music. What qualifies me for this project are my skills in data analysis and vizualization, as well as my sheer interest in the project.\nI’m motivated to complete this project soon because the church will soon release a new hymnal, at which point all of my data will be obsolete. I hope that I can get these results out there so that people can use it help them with their callings, so the church can use it when designing the new hymnal, and to provide a snapshot of hymn usage data before the 1985 hymnal is phased out.\nI’ve been primary pianist twice and sacrament accompanist twice, but not for too long because I find myself getting called to other positions. Ironically, I’ve never been a music coordinator, so I’ve never had the responsibility of choosing sacrament hymns! I live in Spanish Fork, Utah with my wife and three kids."
