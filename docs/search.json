    "text": "If you would like to contribute to this project, email me at hymnstats@gmail.com. Here are the best ways you can help out:\n\nSomeone in your ward likely keeps a spreadsheet that has the past few weeks/months/years of hymns sung in sacrament meeting in your ward. This is typically shared between the music chairperson, chorister(s), organist(s), and a bishopric member. If you or someone close to you has access to that spreadsheet, you can simply send a copy to me. This is probably the best way to contribute to this project.\nIf you have a collection of old sacrament meeting programs from your ward, either digital or physical, those usually list the hymns that were sung that week. (I know hardly anyone carries physical scriptures anymore, but look through those to see if there are any old ones tucked away in there!) You can either write down the information from those programs onto a new spreadsheet or document and send me that, or just send me copies of the programs themselves.\nStart keeping track yourself. Make a note on your phone and add to it each week. Or just shoot me an email each week too.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if the sacrament meeting info you send me is recent or not. One ward sent me information from 2003! It also doesn’t matter if there are gaps in your contribution. So if you have data from 2018 and then more from 2023 but missed the years in between, that’s totally fine!\nAny amount of data helps—even if it’s just from a single week or two! Again, email whatever contributions you have to hymnstats@gmail.com and I’ll incorporate it into the analysis as quickly as I can!"

    "text": "Welcome to the LDS Hymn Stats project! The purpose of this project is to discover what hymns are most commonly sung generally and in certain times of the year in sacrament meetings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have gathered information on what hymns were sung in over 5,000 sacrament meetings from around the world over the past 20 years. This site gives some of the more important findings; I am writing a short book that contains more detailed results."

    "text": "Project Overview\nHave you ever wondered what the most common hymn is in sacrament meeting? I can tell you right now: it’s I Stand All Amazed (193) and it’s sung, on average, once every four and a half months in a given ward. What hymn is least common? Well, that’s a trickier question to answer, but if you ignore the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal, some of the least common hymns in sacrament meeting are Sons of Michael, He Approaches (51), This House We Dedicate to Thee (245), Go, Ye Messengers of Glory (262), and God Save the King (341).\nWhat is the most popular Christmas hymn? It looks like it’s Joy to the World (201). If that matches your intuition, then that’s good news because it’s means I’ve got good data! But, what is the most popular Mother’s Day hymn? Thanksgiving? Valentine’s Day?\nWith this project, I have been able to answer some of these simpler questions, but I’ve also been able to uncover some subtler patterns as well. Like, what Christmas hymns are typically sung the third Sunday in December? (The First Noel (213) might be the most likely.) On the Sunday after Thanksgiving (in the United States), do people sing more Thanksgiving hymns, Christmas hymns, or neither? Are there “unofficial” sacrament hymns that are sung more than any of the “official” ones? What percentage of wards outside of Utah (but still in the US) sing Pioneer Day hymns around Pioneer Day?\nI’ve also uncovered some of what might go through a music chairperson’s head as they select what hymns are to be sung in their ward. It seems like the more popular Christmas hymns are reserved for Sundays when it is anticipated that the most number of people will be in attendance, and the less popular ones are used during peak travel dates. Even though the entry for “Thanksgiving” in topic index in the back of the hymnal directs readers to the “Gratitude” for more hymns, very few people actually use those gratitude-themed hymns around Thanksgiving. Easter hymns trump both General Conference– and Fast Sunday–themed hymns in April, and Fourth of July trumps Fast Sunday hymns.\nFurthermore, I’ve been able to uncover patterns that say something interesting about Mormon culture. For example, Mother’s Day hymns are typically about earthly mothers while Father’s Day hymns are about Heavenly Father. Enough Utahns have relocated to other parts of the US that Pioneer Day may be considered a de facto LDS holiday. And a decent number of wards systematically cycle through the 28 sacrament hymns, sometimes for years without any deviation.\nAs a secondary part of this project, I’m also addressing questions about the music of the hymns. What hymn has the highest melody note? Well, if you exclude the women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal and the optional note at the end of Carry On (255), it’s the F# in the rarely-sung Lean on My Ample Arm (120). What part has the narrowest range? What is the most common key signature? How many hymns could you sing the tenor line for if you can only go up to a Bb? What is the most common final chord? How many hymns don’t end on “do”? How many add9 chords are there in the hymnal?"

    "text": "My name is Joey Stanley and I’ve been working on this project since 2013. It started with one simple question: “What is the most common hymn?” Initially, I sought to answer this question by collecting a year’s worth of data from 1000 wards across the country. A pipe dream if there ever was one. But I have been able to get enough data to the point where I believe I’ve hit a critical mass. It’s more than a lifetime’s worth of sacrament meetings for any one person (even if you attend multiple sacrament meetings for a few decades), and enough to uncover some pretty subtle patterns.\nI am a linguistics professor at BYU, which means I am not a statistician or musicologist, though I do have some training in both statistics and music. What qualifies me for this project are my skills in data analysis and vizualization, as well as my sheer interest in the project.\nI’m motivated to complete this project soon because the church will soon release a new hymnal, at which point all of my data will be obsolete. I hope that I can get these results out there so that people can use it help them with their callings, so the church can use it when designing the new hymnal, and to provide a snapshot of hymn usage data before the 1985 hymnal is phased out.\nIf you would like to contribute to the project, please see the contribute tab above."

Some wards systematically cycle through them, which I believe is a perfectly appropriate thing to do to include the widest variety of hymns to the ward. Other wards pick and choose, which inevitably leads to some favorites being sung more and some lesser-known ones falling through the cracks.\nAs we’ll see in \\(\\ref{ch:holidays}\\) when we look at holidays, wards do not always stick to the table of contents at the beginning of the hymnal when choosing appropriate hymns. However, in the case of the sacrament—which is the most important part of our Sunday worship and the primary reason for Sunday gatherings—it’s clear that we adhere strongly to the recommendation. Nevertheless, the addition of Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) shows that there is at least some room for creativity when selecting sacrament hymns."

In theory, if a ward were to systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns, they’d make it through all of them in a little over six months. However, Figure 1 shows that they’re definitely not all sung equally as often as each other.\nMost plots on this page are formatted just like this one here. Hymns that are less common are in the lower left and hymns that are more common are in the upper right. The numbers along the bottom refer to how many times, on average, a ward will sing that hymn within a given year.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sacrament hymns in order of frequency\n\n\nJoining I Stand All Amazed (193) as the most common ones are In Humility, Our Savior (172), There is a Green Hill Far Away (194), and Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (196). Each one of these is sung around two or three times per year, on average, or once every four to five months.\nMost sacrament hymns are sung at least once a year per ward, on average, but there were some that were less common. O Lord of Hosts (178), Again, Our Dear Redeeming Lord (179), and Again, We Meet around the Board (186) each averaged somewhere between once every 13 and 17 months. The least frequent sacrament hymn though was O Thou, Before the World Began (189), showing up about once every two years.\nAlso, keep in mind that some wards in this dataset do in fact systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns. I recalculated the numbers without those wards (Figure 2), and the common hymns were slightly more frequent and the uncommon ones were even rarer. For example, O Thou, Before the World Began (189) jumped down from once every two years to once every three years.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce in a while, a ward will indeed sing some other hymn as a sacrament hymn. Many hymns were selected by at least one ward at least one time, but two stood out. They are O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197) and Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) (Figure 3). There is good reason for why these two were sung as sacrament hymns: if you look up “Sacrament” in the topical index in the back of the hymnal, it is a list of all the hymns from 169–196, but it also includes these two.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them\n\n\nLet’s start with O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197). It was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every four years per ward on average. Given that it feels like a sacrament hymn and like an Easter hymn, it is perfectly placed between the more on-the-nose sacrament hymns (i.e. those about the bread and water) and the more traditional Easter hymns (e.g. He is Risen! (199)). Perhaps some music chairpeople noticed it in the Index and chose it because of that. But, I could see a music chairperson selecting it because they perhaps thought sacrament hymns went from 169–197 instead of 169–196.\nThe oddball though is Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146).

It is not clear to me why this one is listed in the index as a sacrament hymn, but it’s not grouped together with the other sacrament hymns. The “Prayer and Supplication” category of hymns, which is what this is a part of (and rightfully so, in my opinion), is just before the “Sacrament” category. If it, like O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197), fits into both categories, then I think it should be moved to hymn 168 so that it’s less out of left field. This one really should be thought of as an honorary sacrament hymn. Perhaps we’ll see it included in the “official” list of sacrament hymns in the next hymnal.\n\n\n\nFinally, we can look at sacrament hymns that were sung at some other point in a sacrament meeting. Unsurprisingly, I Stand All Amazed (193) is at the top, being sung occasionally as an opening hymn and closing hymn. At only once every 6–7 years, it’s not particularly common to see it sung this way, but it’s still not unheard of. After that, there are a few others like Behold the Great Redeemer Die (191) and There Is a Green Hill Far Away (194) were also used as one of the other hymns, but it was still quite unusual.\nOverall, while singing a specific sacrament hymn elsewhere in the meeting is pretty unusual, the odds of singing any of the sacrament hymns is more common since their frequencies add together. It happened in 61 of the 5211 sacrament meetings I have data from, or 1.1% of them. That means, on average, a ward might since hymn 169–196 at some other point in the meeting approximately once every year and ten months.\n\n\n\nThe findings in this section suggest that were have a strong tradition of singing hymns 169 through 196 in our sacrament meetings immediately before the sacrament itself.

    "text": "Frequency\nLet’s take a closer look at the sacrament hymns themselves. In theory, if a ward were to systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns, they’d make it through all of them in a little over six months. However, Figure 1 shows that they’re definitely not all sung equally as often as each other.\nMost plots on this page are formatted just like this one here. Hymns that are less common are in the lower left and hymns that are more common are in the upper right. The numbers along the bottom refer to how many times, on average, a ward will sing that hymn within a given year.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sacrament hymns in order of frequency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining I Stand All Amazed (193) as the most common ones are In Humility, Our Savior (172), There is a Green Hill Far Away (194), and Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (196). Each one of these is sung around two or three times per year, on average, or once every four to five months.\nMost sacrament hymns are sung at least once a year per ward, on average, but there were some that were less common. O Lord of Hosts (178), Again, Our Dear Redeeming Lord (179), and Again, We Meet around the Board (186) each averaged somewhere between once every 13 and 17 months. The least frequent sacrament hymn though was O Thou, Before the World Began (189), showing up about once every two years.\nAlso, keep in mind that some wards in this dataset do in fact systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns. I recalculated the numbers without those wards (Figure 2), and the common hymns were slightly more frequent and the uncommon ones were even rarer. For example, O Thou, Before the World Began (189) jumped down from once every two years to once every three years.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them"

    "text": "Non-sacrament hymns\nOnce in a while, a ward will indeed sing some other hymn as a sacrament hymn. Many hymns were selected by at least one ward at least one time, but two stood out. They are O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197) and Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) (Figure 3). There is good reason for why these two were sung as sacrament hymns: if you look up “Sacrament” in the topical index in the back of the hymnal, it is a list of all the hymns from 169–196, but it also includes these two.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them\n\n\nLet’s start with O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197). It was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every four years per ward on average. Given that it feels like a sacrament hymn and like an Easter hymn, it is perfectly placed between the more on-the-nose sacrament hymns (i.e. those about the bread and water) and the more traditional Easter hymns (e.g. He is Risen! (199)). Perhaps some music chairpeople noticed it in the Index and chose it because of that. But, I could see a music chairperson selecting it because they perhaps thought sacrament hymns went from 169–197 instead of 169–196.\nThe oddball though is Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146). In fact, it was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every two years per ward, which is just about as often as O Thou, Before the World Began (189). It is not clear to me why this one is listed in the index as a sacrament hymn, but it’s not grouped together with the other sacrament hymns. The “Prayer and Supplication” category of hymns, which is what this is a part of (and rightfully so, in my opinion), is just before the “Sacrament” category. If it, like O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197), fits into both categories, then I think it should be moved to hymn 168 so that it’s less out of left field. This one really should be thought of as an honorary sacrament hymn. Perhaps we’ll see it included in the “official” list of sacrament hymns in the next hymnal."

    "text": "Sacrament hymns sung elsewhere\nFinally, we can look at sacrament hymns that were sung at some other point in a sacrament meeting. Unsurprisingly, I Stand All Amazed (193) is at the top, being sung occasionally as an opening hymn and closing hymn. At only once every 6–7 years, it’s not particularly common to see it sung this way, but it’s still not unheard of. After that, there are a few others like Behold the Great Redeemer Die (191) and There Is a Green Hill Far Away (194) were also used as one of the other hymns, but it was still quite unusual.\nOverall, while singing a specific sacrament hymn elsewhere in the meeting is pretty unusual, the odds of singing any of the sacrament hymns is more common since their frequencies add together. It happened in 61 of the 5211 sacrament meetings I have data from, or 1.1% of them. That means, on average, a ward might since hymn 169–196 at some other point in the meeting approximately once every year and ten months."

    "text": "The mosts common hymns\nThe most common hymns sung in the church, according to my data, are displayed in Figure 1. Here, sacrament hymns are in gray and other hymns are in black. I’ve shown only the hymns that are sung, on average, one or more times per year per ward. We see a nice list of 22 hymns that are probably well-known by most members of the church. They are generic enough to be appropriate for most meetings. Their message is centered on Christ and other foundational tenents of our religion. Some are more common around certain holidays, like Come, Come Ye Saints (30) around Pioneer Day in Utah or Love At Home (294) around Mother’s Day, but they’re also general enough to be appropriate at other times of the year as well. Thus, what we see in Figure 1 is a solid list of the most popular hymns in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.You may think that a lot of hymns that pertain to specific holidays would make it onto this list, but as we’ll see in later blog posts about annual trends, there are actually relatively few festive hymns that are sung by most wards most years.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The “favorites”: Hymns that are sung at least once per year\n\n\nFigure 1 also shows how common each of these hymns are. Many sacrament hymns are sung, on average, more than twice a year. (Keep in mind that there are only 48 sacrament meetings per year, and 28 sacrament hymns to choose from, so many will have to double up.) None of the non-sacrament hymns were sung, on average, more than twice a year. But the sheer fact that this plot exists—a display of all the hymns thare are sung at least once a year on average—means that some wards do sing them more than once a year.\nThis list of favorites is useful because if you are a new ward organist, these are the hymns to practice first. Learning these 22 hymns (plus the sacrament hymns) will get you the most mileage. In fact, these 46 hymns account for 43% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting in this sample. That means that if you learn the hymns shown in Figure 1, you’ll be able to play almost half of the meetings in your ward.\n\nAre these the “standards”?\nIt is interesting to compare this list of “favorites” to the list in the back of the hymnal under the section “Hymns for Stake Conference” (page 381). That section lists “standard, well-known hymns” and it is implied that many members would have these hymns memorized. Interestingly, there is not a lot of overlap between these lists. Figure 2 shows which hymns appear in Figure 1 and are usually sung more than once a year (excluding sacrament hymns), and which are the “standards” listed in the back of the hymnal. This time, the hymns in purple are ones that are recommended as “standards” and are indeed sung pretty regularly. The blue ones are what are sung pretty often but are not one of “the standards” listed in the back of the hymnal. The red ones are recommended “standards” that are not as popular. Most of lesser-popular “standards” are still sung pretty regularly, usually at least once every two years. The exception is Come, O Thou King of Kings (59), which is sung less than once every two years and is not what I would consider to be a popular hymn.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Standard vs. Popular hymns. Here, “standard” means they’re recommended in the back of the hymnal as a well-known hymn. “Popular” means they’re sung more than once a year according to this sample. Sacrament hymns are excluded.\n\n\nHowever, it should be kept in mind that this isn’t exactly a fair comparison. For one, this list of “standards” is what is recommended for stake conference, which is not the same as sacrament meeting. Also, this list printed in the back of the hymnal is presumably what was recommended in 1985 when this hymnal was first published. What is considered a standard has surely changed in the past few decades. Furthermore, many of the currently most popular hymns were new additions to the 1985 hymnal, including Because I Have Been Given Much (219), I Believe in Christ (134), I Am a Child of God (301), and Called to Serve (249). It makes sense that they’re not recommended in the back of the hymnal because they were brand new when that list was published! How could they have know they’d be so popular? My recommendation for the church would be to update the list of stake conference recommendations to include these most popular hymns and to remove the ones that are less common today."

My recommendation for the church would be to update the list of stake conference recommendations to include these most popular hymns and to remove the ones that are less common today."

    "text": "The most common sacrament hymn is “I Stand All Amazed” (193). In this plot, you can see that it’s sung on average, about once every four and a half months per year per ward. 1/n INSERT IMAGE\nOther common sacrament hymns are “In Humility, Our Savior” (172), “There is a Green Hill Far Away” (194), and “Jesus, Once of Humble Birth” (196). Each of these is sung around 2–3 times per year, on average, or once every four to five months. 2/n\nMost sacrament hymns are sung at least once a year per ward, on average, but there were some that were less common. “O Lord of Hosts (178)”, “Again, Our Dear Redeeming Lord (179)”, and “Again, We Meet around the Board (186)” each averaged once every 13–17 months. 3/n\nKeep in mind that some wards systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns. Including these wards evens out the numbers a little bit. When I excluded them, the common hymns were slightly more frequent and the uncommon ones were even rarer. 4/n INSERT IMAGE\nThe least frequent sacrament hymn is “O Thou, Before the World Began” (189). It’s sung, on average, about once every two years. But if your ward doesn’t systematically cycle through the hymns though, it’s sung only about once every three years. 5/n\nIn the “Sacrament” section of the topic index, it lists two additional hymns: “O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown” (197) and “Gently Raise the Sacred Strain” (146). The first one is more Eastery and the second is more “Prayer and Supplication”-y, so that makes sense. 6/n\n“O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown” (197) was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every four years. “Gently Raise the Sacred Strain” (146) was about once every two years, which is more than some “official” sacrament hymns! 7/n INSERT IMAGE\nVery occasionally, a ward will sing a sacrament hymn as the opening, closing, or intermediate hymn. This is most common with “I Stand All Amazed” (193). Across all 28 hymns, it happens about 1.1% of the time, or once every 22 months in a given ward, on average. 8/n\nIn conclusion, it appears that we stick pretty close to the “rules” about that second hymn in sacrament meeting. Some wards cycle through while others pick and choose. Some are favorites and some are less common and two are “honorary” members of the group. 9/9\nYou can read more about these findings at https://hymnstats.joeystanley.com/findings.html#sacrament-hymns.

If you would like to contribute your ward’s hymn data, please visit https://hymnstats.joeystanley.com/contribute.html. 11/9\n\n\n\nThe most common hymn sung in sacrament meeting overall is “I Stand All Amazed” (193). In fact, the top 15 most common hymns are sacrament hymns. If we disregard those, the most common hymn is “I Know that My Redeemer Lives (136).” 1/n INSERT FIGURE\nThe top three most popular hymns are “I Know That My Redeemer Lives (136),” “How Firm a Foundation (85),” and “Because I Have Been Given Much (219).” Each of these are sung, on average, at least 1.5 times per year per ward. That seems low, but that’s what the data show. 2/n\nOther popular hymns include “Lord, I Would Follow Thee (220),” and “I Believe in Christ (134),” “High on the Mountain Top (5),” “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19),” and “Now Let Us Rejoice (3),” which are each sung every 9.5 months or so, on average, per ward. 3/n\nAnother 14 hymns are sung, on average, more than once per year per ward, not including sacrament hymns. 4/n\nInterestingly, the back of the hymnbook has a list of “standard” hymns that presumably everyone knows that would be good for stake conference. Only about half of those “standard” hymns are actually sung more than once a year. 5/n INSERT IMAGE\nThe fact that the standard hymns aren’t the same as the popular ones means that what we consider our favorites has shifted in the past 38 years since the hymnal came out. I personally wouldn’t consider “Come, O Thou King of Kings (59)” as particularly popular. 6/n\nYou can read more about these findings at https://hymnstats.joeystanley.com/posts/most_common_hymns.html.

    "text": "I was talking to someone about this project, and they said something like, “Our ward does a good job at singing unusual hymns. We probably get through the entire hymnal every year.” I can tell you now that’s impossible. Let’s explore that a little bit.\nThere are 52 weeks in a year. Subtract two for General Conference and subtract two for Stake Conference. You’re left with 48 sacrament meetings per year. If you sang an opening, sacrament, intermediate, and closing hymn in all 48 of those meetings, that’s 196 hymns. But, subtract 12 for Fast Sundays, which have no intermediate hymn. So, you’re left with a maximum of 184 sung per year per ward. That’s assuming zero special musical numbers ever.Okay, some years have 53 Sundays, but for simplicity, we’ll keep it at 52For what it’s worth, I assume 48 sacrament meetings per year for everything in this project.\nWell, right off the bat, we know that you can’t possibly get through the entire hymnal in a year, because there are 341 hymns! Even if you exclude the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back and God Save the King, that’s 310 hymns.\nBut, let’s not forget that sacrament hymns almost always have to be one of the hymns in the 169–196 range. There are 28 of them. We’ll assume you get through all 28 of them, but not all wards do because there are a few that are clearly less popular than others. So, if 48 of your 184 hymns are tied up as sacrament hymns, that means you’ll have to repeat some. That leaves 136 remaining opening, intermediate, and closing hymn slots. If you didn’t repeat any and had zero special musical numbers, then yes, you could sing 136 unique hymns, plus the 28 sacrament hymns, for a total of 164 unique hymns per year. That is the maximum any ward could do.\nIf you really were determined to all 310 hymns without repeating, except for sacrament hymns, it would take 94 weeks to do so, or just shy of two years, under perfect conditions. But having special musical numbers and ward choirs makes it impossible to reach that goal. I currently have 17,993 hymns from 5,345 sacrament meetings. Simple division shows that…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe average number of hymns sung in sacrament meeting is 3.37.\n\n\nThat means—across my dataset—only about a third of the time will a ward sing an intermediate hymn. If, across a few weeks or months, your ward has a lower number than that, then you have more special musical numbers than a typical ward. If your average is higher, it means you have fewer.\nLet’s recalculate our numbers then. If there are 48 weeks, and 3.37 hymns per week, that’s a max of 162 (I’ll round up) total hymns sung per ward per year. 48 of those are chewed up by the 28 sacrament hymns, so you’re left with 114 slots for the rest of the hymnal. If you didn’t repeat any and add back the 28 sacrament hymns, that’s a max of 142 unique hymns per year. And if you’re only able to get through 2.37 new hymns per week, and there are 282 non-sacrament hymns to get through, it would take 119 weeks to get through all of them, or just about two and a half years."

    "text": "So how many hymns do wards sing per year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nMost wards sing around 107 unique hymns per year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical details for nerds :)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get this number, I started off with the 20 wards from which I have at least a year’s worth of data. I didn’t want to base the calculation on wards that contributed less data because it messes with the results.\nBut, even with these 20 wards, I can’t simply divide the number of unique hymns by the number of sacrament meetings because the more data I have from a ward, the more likely they are to sing a rather unusual hymn. It pretty neatly follows some sort of exponential distribution.\n\nSo, because of math, it’s not meaningful to compare six years of data from one ward to one year of data from another ward.\nI tried a rolling cumulative sum of unique hymns, but I didn’t know how to implement that in R. So instead, I implemented a bootstrapping technique and sampled 48 meetings, without replacement, 100 times per ward, and got that average. The standard deviation was 3.68—a surprisingly narrow distribution if you ask me.\n\n\n\nAssuming about 24–28 of those are sacrament hymns, that means most wards only sing about 80 or so unique non-sacrament hymns per year. Furthermore, 28 of those 80 hymns are repeated each year.\nThe most variety of hymns I have in my dataset is 130 unique hymns per ward. That’s pretty good, and certainly much better than average. The year with the least variety was one ward that sang just 90 unique hymns in a year. Considering that many of the holiday hymns aren’t going to be repeated, it means that many (and perhaps most) of the non-festive hymns were repeated that year.\nThese numbers should be taken with a grain of salt because it’s only based on 20 wards. If you have access to a year’s worth of data from your ward, please visit the contribute page!"

See Table 1 for exact numbers.\n\n\nIf you know the hymnal well, nothing about this figure should come as a surprise. The modern hymnal tends to use key signatures that have few sharps or flats. There are about as many hymns in the D major as there are in C major and Eb major. There are slightly fewer hymns in F and Bb major for some reason. Eb major is the standout because even though it has more flats than Bb and F, it outnumbers those two. In general though, the further in the circle of fourths you go from G major, the fewer hymns there are.That wasn’t necessarily true of previous versions.

The key of A major, with three sharps, is only found in two hymns: the men’s chorus arrangement of An Angel from on High (328) and How Wondrous and Great (267). Since the first is a men’s chorus arrangement, it was never sung in sacrament meeting in my data. The second was sung about once every 4.5–5 years, so an unusual hymn for sure, but more common than many others.\nThe other marginal key signature is Db and, again, just two hymns are in that key. As the Shadows Fall (168) was sung just four times in my data, or once every roughly 28 years. The other, Softly Beams the Sacred Dawning (56), was sung just once in my sample, meaning it’s sung about once every 114 years. Because of how unusual these hymns are, these numbers are very rough guesses; perhaps we can think of them as “once in a generation” and “once in a lifetime.” The point is, it is very unusual to sing a hymn in Db.\nFor what it’s worth, there is one hymn that actually changes keys partway though. Welcome, Welcome, Sabbath Morning (280) starts in C major, shifts to G major, and then back to C major. For the purposes of this study, I’m treating it as being in C major the entire time."

    "section": "Why is G major the most common?",
    "text": "Why is G major the most common?\nI’m not a musicologist, but I can speculate as to why G is more common than C. It may be the case that many melodies are centered around the tonic, and extend roughly a fifth above it and roughly a fourth or fifth below it, with a total range of about an octave. If that’s the case, a comfortable octave for many singers is from D to D, which means the key of G would be an appropriate key signature. A good example of this is Love One another (308), in the left panel of Figure 3, which shows the distribution of notes in the melody, with the tonic highlighted in blue.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Tonic within ranges (melody lines). Tonics are highlighted in blue.\n\n\nOther melodies also span a full octave but the highest and lowest notes are the tonic itself. A good example of this is All Creatures of Our God and King (62), the right panel of Figure 3. For melodies such as these, a key signature like D (or in this case, Eb) would be more appropriate so that the melody does not go too high or too low.\nSo, it may be the case then that the reason why G major is the most common key is because there are more melodies like Love One another (308) than like All Creatures of Our God and King (62). (Looking through plots like what you see in Figure 3 but for all the hymns in the key of G, it seems like pretty much all of them look similar to Love One another (308).)\nAlong similar lines, if a piece is set to the key of G, the basses get to end the piece on a strong low note that many men, particularly men who sing bass lines, can hit. It’s nice to end a piece with the tonic being the lowest note of the bass line, and the entire hymn. Some examples of these hymns include Do What is Right (237) (shown in Figure 4) and God, Our Father, Hear Us Pray (170). Other hymns, such as those set in C major or Bb major, have the dominant (or fifth note of the scale) as the lowest note of the bass line, sometimes near the very end of the piece, like in Silent Night (203) (shown in Figure 4) or The Spirit of God (2). While dropping down to a low dominant (in this case F if it’s in the key of Bb) can be a nice way to close a piece, I think a stronger finish is to end with the lowest note being the dominant, hence the greater number of hymns set in the key of G.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Tonic within ranges (bass lines).

    "text": "What about minor keys?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nExactly five hymns are set in a minor key.\n\n\nYou can see the five hymns in a minor key in Figure 5. The most common is, perhaps unsurprisingly, If You Could Hie to Kolab (284) although it’s not especially frequent and is only sung about once every two and a half years or so. Next is the New Year’s Day hymn, Ring Out, Wild Bells (215). We’ll talk more about holidays later on, but it’s only sung by 39% of wards around New Year’s Day. A distant third is That Easter Morn (198) which, from my intuition, is punching above its weight because only 16% of wards sing it around Easter. The last two, Lord, We Come Before Thee Now (162) and How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True? (126)  are pretty unusual and are sung about once every 13 years and once every 60 years or so, respectively.Although, if your ward ever does one of those musical testimony meetings where people get up and say what their favorite hymn is and then everyone sings a verse of that, I suspect you’re pretty much guaranteed to sing it then.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Hymns set in a minor key\n\n\nSo, if you sing a hymn in a minor key, it’s probably one of the two holiday ones or If You Could Hie to Kolab (284). I can’t help but think that the reason If You Could Hie to Kolab (284) is so popular is because it’s set in a minor key. It’s a pretty obscure piece of doctrine that it’s talking about and I wonder if it were set to a different tune if it’d be as popular. In other words, do people like it because of the words or because of the music? Also, for what it’s worth, the distribution of notes looks very much like Love One another (308) (the left panel in Figure 3)."

    "text": "But do we actually see G major the most?\nSo we’ve addressed the question of what key signature the most number of hymns are set to. But, does that actually mean that’s the most that we see? What’s the difference? It may be the case that tons of hymns in G major are really obscure ones that hardly anyone ever sees. So, if we take frequency into account, perhaps another key is seen more often, even if fewer hymns are actually in it.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Likelihood of key signatures\n\n\nFigure 2 looks similar to Figure 1 except I’ve adjusted the heights of the bars based on how frequent each hymn is. If a hymn is more common, it’ll raise the bar for its key signature more. If it’s less common, it’ll raise it less.\nWhile superficially the two plots may look similar, there are some important differences. (See Table 1 as well.) First, D major is closer in height to G major. While only about 15.6% of the hymns are in D, they’re sung about 19.3% of the time. This is likely due to some pretty common sacrament hymns like Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (196), O God, the Eternal Father (175), and In Memory of the Crucified (190) as well as some other heavy hitters like I Believe in Christ (134) and We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19).\nMost of the other key signatures are pretty similar. C major and F major are more or less unchanged. Though 12.3% of hymns are set in Bb major, they’re only sung about 9.3% of the time. And while Ab major is only used in 6.4% of the hymns, it’s sung 5.2% of the time in sacrament meeting. (No doubt, I Stand All Amazed (193) is doing the lion’s share of the work there.)\nPerhaps the biggest change is that Eb is quite a bit more commonly seen than you’d expect based on how many hymns there are in it. 14.3% of hymns are in Eb, but 17.4% of the hymns actually sung in sacrament meeting are in Eb. Undoubtedly, it’s because nine of the 28 sacrament hymns are in Eb. So, to put it another way, on average, hymns in Eb major are more common than hymns in C major or even Bb major.\nFinally, the fact that the keys of A and Db major are mere slivers in Figure 2 reflects what was explained above that they’re really uncommon.\nTo put some numbers to this, interestingly, still 22% of hymns that are actually sung in sacrament meeting are in the key of G. D jumps The keys of D, C, F, Bb, and Eb each have 12%–15% of the hymns. Ab is less common, with about 6% of the hymns.\nFigure 2 probably has the most useful application out of anything else in this blog post. If you’re a budding musician and are still getting used to key signatures, the good news is that you don’t have to learn all twelve keys to play the hymnal. If you focus your efforts on hymns in G, D, and Eb, you’ll get the most milage out of your practice.\n\n\nTable 1: Key Signature Frequencies\n\n\nKey Signature\n# of hymns\n% of hymnal\n% of hymns sung\n\n\n\n\nA\n2\n0.6%\n0.1%\n\n\nD\n56\n15.7%\n19.3%\n\n\nG\n79\n22.1%\n22.3%\n\n\nC\n52\n14.6%\n13.4%\n\n\nF\n48\n13.4%\n12.8%\n\n\nBb\n44\n12.3%\n9.3%\n\n\nEb\n51\n14.3%\n17.4%\n\n\nAb\n23\n6.4%\n5.2%\n\n\nDb\n2\n0.6%\n0.003%"
