    "text": "Someone in your ward likely keeps a spreadsheet that has the past few weeks/months/years of hymns sung in sacrament meeting in your ward. This is typically shared between the music chairperson, chorister(s), organist(s), and a bishopric member. If you or someone close to you has access to that spreadsheet, you can simply send a copy to me. This is probably the best way to contribute to this project.\nIf you have a collection of old sacrament meeting programs from your ward, either digital or physical, those usually list the hymns that were sung that week. (I know hardly anyone carries physical scriptures anymore, but look through those to see if there are any old ones tucked away in there!) You can either write down the information from those programs onto a new spreadsheet or document and send me that, or just send me copies of the programs themselves.\nStart keeping track yourself. Make a note on your phone and add to it each week. Or just shoot me an email each week too.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if the sacrament meeting info you send me is recent or not. One ward sent me information from 2003! It also doesn’t matter if there are gaps in your contribution. So if you have data from 2018 and then more from 2023 but missed the years in between, that’s totally fine!\nAny amount of data helps—even if it’s just from a single week or two! Again, email whatever contributions you have to hymnstats@gmail.com and I’ll incorporate it into the analysis as quickly as I can!"

    "text": "Project Overview\nHave you ever wondered what the most common hymn is in sacrament meeting? I can tell you right now: it’s I Stand All Amazed (193) and it’s sung, on average, once every four and a half months in a given ward. What hymn is least common? Well, that’s a trickier question to answer, but if you ignore the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal, some of the least common hymns in sacrament meeting are Sons of Michael, He Approaches (51), This House We Dedicate to Thee (245), Go, Ye Messengers of Glory (262), and God Save the King (341).\nWhat is the most popular Christmas hymn? It looks like it’s Joy to the World (201). If that matches your intuition, then that’s good news because it’s means I’ve got good data! But, what is the most popular Mother’s Day hymn? Thanksgiving? Valentine’s Day?\nWith this project, I have been able to answer some of these simpler questions, but I’ve also been able to uncover some subtler patterns as well. Like, what Christmas hymns are typically sung the third Sunday in December? (The First Noel (213) might be the most likely.) On the Sunday after Thanksgiving (in the United States), do people sing more Thanksgiving hymns, Christmas hymns, or neither? Are there “unofficial” sacrament hymns that are sung more than any of the “official” ones? What percentage of wards outside of Utah (but still in the US) sing Pioneer Day hymns around Pioneer Day?\nI’ve also uncovered some of what might go through a music chairperson’s head as they select what hymns are to be sung in their ward. It seems like the more popular Christmas hymns are reserved for Sundays when it is anticipated that the most number of people will be in attendance, and the less popular ones are used during peak travel dates. Even though the entry for “Thanksgiving” in topic index in the back of the hymnal directs readers to the “Gratitude” for more hymns, very few people actually use those gratitude-themed hymns around Thanksgiving. Easter hymns trump both General Conference– and Fast Sunday–themed hymns in April, and Fourth of July trumps Fast Sunday hymns.\nFurthermore, I’ve been able to uncover patterns that say something interesting about Mormon culture. For example, Mother’s Day hymns are typically about earthly mothers while Father’s Day hymns are about Heavenly Father. Enough Utahns have relocated to other parts of the US that Pioneer Day may be considered a de facto LDS holiday. And a decent number of wards systematically cycle through the 28 sacrament hymns, sometimes for years without any deviation.\nAs a secondary part of this project, I’m also addressing questions about the music of the hymns. What hymn has the highest melody note? Well, if you exclude the women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal and the optional note at the end of Carry On (255), it the F# in the rarely-sung Lean on My Ample Arm (120). What part has the narrowest range? What is the most common key signature? How many hymns could you sing the tenor line for if you can only go up to a Bb? What is the most common final chord? How many hymns don’t end on “do”? How many add9 chords are there in the hymnal?"

    "text": "The most common hymn is I Stand All Amazed (193). It is sung, on average, once every four and a half months within a given ward. It should come as no surprise that this hymn is a sacrament hymn, or rather, the second hymn sung in sacrament meeting and the one just before the blessing and passing of the sacrament. In fact, because we almost always sing one of 28 sacrament hymns every week, those hymns are going to be more common than most other hymns. So, to fully appreciate the most common hymns, let’s first talk about the sacrament hymns by themselves. We’ll then move on to the most frequent non-sacrament hymns. We’ll then move down the line to less and less frequent hymns until we get to the ones that are hardly sung at all. We’ll also take a tangent into the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal.\n\n\nWe’ll start off by looking at sacrament hymns, or rather, the hymn sung immediately before the sacrament is blessed and passed to the congregation. As far as I can tell, §19.3.2 of the General Handbook has the only instruction about sacrament hymns, and it says that “[t]he sacrament hymn should refer to the sacrament itself or to the sacrifice of the Savior.” This instruction is repeated on page 380 of the hymnal.\nIn the hymnal, sacrament hymns go from 169 (As Now We Take the Sacrament) to 196 (Jesus, Once of Humble Birth), at least according to the Table of Contents. As far as I can tell, it doesn’t specifically state that the sacrament hymn must be one of the 28 within that range, but I think it’s a generally accepted that that’s what that phrase from the handbook means.In fact, I’ve had church leaders enforce this constraint. I was in a ward where a newly-called music chairperson chose reverent hymns that were outside of that range. After about two weeks, the bishop announced that we’d be singing a different hymn than what was listed on the program and he changed it to a sacrament hymn. Presumably he later explained the policy to the chorister afterwards because we sang “true” sacrament hymns from then on.\nAs it turns out, I Stand All Amazed (193) is part of that group. So it should come as no surprise that a sacrament hymn is the most common hymn overall. That one in particular focuses less on the sacrament itself and more on the Atonement, so it could be used outside of sacrament contexts without feeling out of place. In fact, a quick look at the numbers suggests that it was, in fact, sung as opening and closing hymns at least three times more often than any other sacrament hymn. This may explain why it stands out as the most commonly sung hymn in sacrament meetings.\n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the sacrament hymns themselves. In theory, if a ward were to systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns, they’d make it through all of them in a little over six months. However, Figure 1 shows that they’re definitely not all sung equally as often as each other.\nMost plots on this page are formatted just like this one here. Hymns that are less common are in the lower left and hymns that are more common are in the upper right. The numbers along the bottom refer to how many times, on average, a ward will sing that hymn within a given year.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sacrament hymns in order of frequency\n\n\nJoining I Stand All Amazed (193) as the most common ones are In Humility, Our Savior (172), There is a Green Hill Far Away (194), and Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (196). Each one of these is sung around two or three times per year, on average, or once every four to five months.\nMost sacrament hymns are sung at least once a year per ward, on average, but there were some that were less common. O Lord of Hosts (178), Again, Our Dear Redeeming Lord (179), and Again, We Meet around the Board (186) each averaged somewhere between once every 13 and 17 months. The least frequent sacrament hymn though was O Thou, Before the World Began (189), showing up about once every two years.\nAlso, keep in mind that some wards in this dataset do in fact systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns. I recalculated the numbers without those wards (Figure 2), and the common hymns were slightly more frequent and the uncommon ones were even rarer. For example, O Thou, Before the World Began (189) jumped down from once every two years to once every three years.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce in a while, a ward will indeed sing some other hymn as a sacrament hymn. Many hymns were selected by at least one ward at least one time, but two stood out. They are O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197) and Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) (Figure 3). There is good reason for why these two were sung as sacrament hymns: if you look up “Sacrament” in the topical index in the back of the hymnal, it is a list of all the hymns from 169–196, but it also includes these two.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them\n\n\nLet’s start with O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197). It was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every four years per ward on average. Given that it feels like a sacrament hymn and like an Easter hymn, it is perfectly placed between the more on-the-nose sacrament hymns (i.e. those about the bread and water) and the more traditional Easter hymns (e.g. He is Risen! (199)). Perhaps some music chairpeople noticed it in the Index and chose it because of that. But, I could see a music chairperson selecting it because they perhaps thought sacrament hymns went from 169–197 instead of 169–196.\nThe oddball though is Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146). In fact, it was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every two years per ward, which is just about as often as O Thou, Before the World Began (189). It is not clear to me why this one is listed in the index as a sacrament hymn, but it’s not grouped together with the other sacrament hymns. The “Prayer and Supplication” category of hymns, which is what this is a part of (and rightfully so, in my opinion), is just before the “Sacrament” category. If it, like O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197), fits into both categories, then I think it should be moved to hymn 168 so that it’s less out of left field. This one really should be thought of as an honorary sacrament hymn. Perhaps we’ll see it included in the “official” list of sacrament hymns in the next hymnal.\n\n\n\nFinally, we can look at sacrament hymns that were sung at some other point in a sacrament meeting. Unsurprisingly, I Stand All Amazed (193) is at the top, being sung occasionally as an opening hymn and closing hymn. At only once every 6–7 years, it’s not particularly common to see it sung this way, but it’s still not unheard of. After that, there are a few others like Behold the Great Redeemer Die (191) and There Is a Green Hill Far Away (194) were also used as one of the other hymns, but it was still quite unusual.\nOverall, while singing a specific sacrament hymn elsewhere in the meeting is pretty unusual, the odds of singing any of the sacrament hymns is more common since their frequencies add together. It happened in 61 of the 5211 sacrament meetings I have data from, or 1.1% of them. That means, on average, a ward might since hymn 169–196 at some other point in the meeting approximately once every year and ten months.\n\n\n\nThe findings in this section suggest that were have a strong tradition of singing hymns 169 through 196 in our sacrament meetings immediately before the sacrament itself. Some wards systematically cycle through them, which I believe is a perfectly appropriate thing to do to include the widest variety of hymns to the ward. Other wards pick and choose, which inevitably leads to some favorites being sung more and some lesser-known ones falling through the cracks.\nAs we’ll see in Section 2 when we look at holidays, wards do not always stick to the table of contents at the beginning of the hymnal when choosing appropriate hymns. However, in the case of the sacrament—which is the most important part of our Sunday worship and the primary reason for Sunday gatherings—it’s clear that we adhere strongly to the recommendation. Nevertheless, the addition of Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) shows that there is at least some room for thinking out of the box when selecting sacrament hymns.\n\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\n\nStay tuned!"
