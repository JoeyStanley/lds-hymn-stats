    "text": "Someone in your ward likely keeps a spreadsheet that has the past few weeks/months/years of hymns sung in sacrament meeting in your ward. This is typically shared between the music chairperson, chorister(s), organist(s), and a bishopric member. If you or someone close to you has access to that spreadsheet, you can simply send a copy to me. This is probably the best way to contribute to this project.\nIf you have a collection of old sacrament meeting programs from your ward, either digital or physical, those usually list the hymns that were sung that week. (I know hardly anyone carries physical scriptures anymore, but look through those to see if there are any old ones tucked away in there!) You can either write down the information from those programs onto a new spreadsheet or document and send me that, or just send me copies of the programs themselves.\nStart keeping track yourself. Make a note on your phone and add to it each week. Or just shoot me an email each week too.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if the sacrament meeting info you send me is recent or not. One ward sent me information from 2003! It also doesn’t matter if there are gaps in your contribution. So if you have data from 2018 and then more from 2023 but missed the years in between, that’s totally fine!\nAny amount of data helps—even if it’s just from a single week or two! Again, email whatever contributions you have to hymnstats@gmail.com and I’ll incorporate it into the analysis as quickly as I can!"

    "text": "Welcome to the LDS Hymn Stats project! The purpose of this project is to discover what hymns are most commonly sung generally and in certain times of the year in sacrament meetings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have gathered information on what hymns were sung in over 5,000 sacrament meetings from around the world over the past 20 years. This site gives some of the more important findings; I am writing a short book that contains more detailed results."

    "text": "Project Overview\nHave you ever wondered what the most common hymn is in sacrament meeting? I can tell you right now: it’s I Stand All Amazed (193) and it’s sung, on average, once every four and a half months in a given ward. What hymn is least common? Well, that’s a trickier question to answer, but if you ignore the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal, some of the least common hymns in sacrament meeting are Sons of Michael, He Approaches (51), This House We Dedicate to Thee (245), Go, Ye Messengers of Glory (262), and God Save the King (341).\nWhat is the most popular Christmas hymn? It looks like it’s Joy to the World (201). If that matches your intuition, then that’s good news because it’s means I’ve got good data! But, what is the most popular Mother’s Day hymn? Thanksgiving? Valentine’s Day?\nWith this project, I have been able to answer some of these simpler questions, but I’ve also been able to uncover some subtler patterns as well. Like, what Christmas hymns are typically sung the third Sunday in December? (The First Noel (213) might be the most likely.) On the Sunday after Thanksgiving (in the United States), do people sing more Thanksgiving hymns, Christmas hymns, or neither? Are there “unofficial” sacrament hymns that are sung more than any of the “official” ones? What percentage of wards outside of Utah (but still in the US) sing Pioneer Day hymns around Pioneer Day?\nI’ve also uncovered some of what might go through a music chairperson’s head as they select what hymns are to be sung in their ward. It seems like the more popular Christmas hymns are reserved for Sundays when it is anticipated that the most number of people will be in attendance, and the less popular ones are used during peak travel dates. Even though the entry for “Thanksgiving” in topic index in the back of the hymnal directs readers to the “Gratitude” for more hymns, very few people actually use those gratitude-themed hymns around Thanksgiving. Easter hymns trump both General Conference– and Fast Sunday–themed hymns in April, and Fourth of July trumps Fast Sunday hymns.\nFurthermore, I’ve been able to uncover patterns that say something interesting about Mormon culture. For example, Mother’s Day hymns are typically about earthly mothers while Father’s Day hymns are about Heavenly Father. Enough Utahns have relocated to other parts of the US that Pioneer Day may be considered a de facto LDS holiday. And a decent number of wards systematically cycle through the 28 sacrament hymns, sometimes for years without any deviation.\nAs a secondary part of this project, I’m also addressing questions about the music of the hymns. What hymn has the highest melody note? Well, if you exclude the women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal and the optional note at the end of Carry On (255), it’s the F# in the rarely-sung Lean on My Ample Arm (120). What part has the narrowest range? What is the most common key signature? How many hymns could you sing the tenor line for if you can only go up to a Bb? What is the most common final chord? How many hymns don’t end on “do”? How many add9 chords are there in the hymnal?"

Some wards systematically cycle through them, which I believe is a perfectly appropriate thing to do to include the widest variety of hymns to the ward. Other wards pick and choose, which inevitably leads to some favorites being sung more and some lesser-known ones falling through the cracks.\nAs we’ll see in \\(\\ref{ch:holidays}\\) when we look at holidays, wards do not always stick to the table of contents at the beginning of the hymnal when choosing appropriate hymns. However, in the case of the sacrament—which is the most important part of our Sunday worship and the primary reason for Sunday gatherings—it’s clear that we adhere strongly to the recommendation. Nevertheless, the addition of Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) shows that there is at least some room for creativity when selecting sacrament hymns."

I was in a ward where a newly-called music chairperson chose reverent hymns that were outside of that range. After about two weeks, the bishop announced that we’d be singing a different hymn than what was listed on the program and he changed it to a sacrament hymn.

However, Figure 1 shows that they’re definitely not all sung equally as often as each other.\nMost plots on this page are formatted just like this one here. Hymns that are less common are in the lower left and hymns that are more common are in the upper right. The numbers along the bottom refer to how many times, on average, a ward will sing that hymn within a given year.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sacrament hymns in order of frequency\n\n\nJoining I Stand All Amazed (193) as the most common ones are In Humility, Our Savior (172), There is a Green Hill Far Away (194), and Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (196). Each one of these is sung around two or three times per year, on average, or once every four to five months.\nMost sacrament hymns are sung at least once a year per ward, on average, but there were some that were less common. O Lord of Hosts (178), Again, Our Dear Redeeming Lord (179), and Again, We Meet around the Board (186) each averaged somewhere between once every 13 and 17 months. The least frequent sacrament hymn though was O Thou, Before the World Began (189), showing up about once every two years.\nAlso, keep in mind that some wards in this dataset do in fact systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns. I recalculated the numbers without those wards (Figure 2), and the common hymns were slightly more frequent and the uncommon ones were even rarer. For example, O Thou, Before the World Began (189) jumped down from once every two years to once every three years.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce in a while, a ward will indeed sing some other hymn as a sacrament hymn. Many hymns were selected by at least one ward at least one time, but two stood out. They are O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197) and Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) (Figure 3). There is good reason for why these two were sung as sacrament hymns: if you look up “Sacrament” in the topical index in the back of the hymnal, it is a list of all the hymns from 169–196, but it also includes these two.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them\n\n\nLet’s start with O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197). It was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every four years per ward on average. Given that it feels like a sacrament hymn and like an Easter hymn, it is perfectly placed between the more on-the-nose sacrament hymns (i.e. those about the bread and water) and the more traditional Easter hymns (e.g. He is Risen! (199)). Perhaps some music chairpeople noticed it in the Index and chose it because of that. But, I could see a music chairperson selecting it because they perhaps thought sacrament hymns went from 169–197 instead of 169–196.\nThe oddball though is Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146). In fact, it was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every two years per ward, which is just about as often as O Thou, Before the World Began (189). It is not clear to me why this one is listed in the index as a sacrament hymn, but it’s not grouped together with the other sacrament hymns. The “Prayer and Supplication” category of hymns, which is what this is a part of (and rightfully so, in my opinion), is just before the “Sacrament” category. If it, like O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197), fits into both categories, then I think it should be moved to hymn 168 so that it’s less out of left field. This one really should be thought of as an honorary sacrament hymn. Perhaps we’ll see it included in the “official” list of sacrament hymns in the next hymnal.\n\n\n\nFinally, we can look at sacrament hymns that were sung at some other point in a sacrament meeting. Unsurprisingly, I Stand All Amazed (193) is at the top, being sung occasionally as an opening hymn and closing hymn. At only once every 6–7 years, it’s not particularly common to see it sung this way, but it’s still not unheard of. After that, there are a few others like Behold the Great Redeemer Die (191) and There Is a Green Hill Far Away (194) were also used as one of the other hymns, but it was still quite unusual.\nOverall, while singing a specific sacrament hymn elsewhere in the meeting is pretty unusual, the odds of singing any of the sacrament hymns is more common since their frequencies add together. It happened in 61 of the 5211 sacrament meetings I have data from, or 1.1% of them. That means, on average, a ward might since hymn 169–196 at some other point in the meeting approximately once every year and ten months.\n\n\n\nThe findings in this section suggest that were have a strong tradition of singing hymns 169 through 196 in our sacrament meetings immediately before the sacrament itself.

O Lord of Hosts (178), Again, Our Dear Redeeming Lord (179), and Again, We Meet around the Board (186) each averaged somewhere between once every 13 and 17 months. The least frequent sacrament hymn though was O Thou, Before the World Began (189), showing up about once every two years.\nAlso, keep in mind that some wards in this dataset do in fact systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns. I recalculated the numbers without those wards (Figure 2), and the common hymns were slightly more frequent and the uncommon ones were even rarer. For example, O Thou, Before the World Began (189) jumped down from once every two years to once every three years.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them"

    "text": "Non-sacrament hymns\nOnce in a while, a ward will indeed sing some other hymn as a sacrament hymn. Many hymns were selected by at least one ward at least one time, but two stood out. They are O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197) and Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) (Figure 3). There is good reason for why these two were sung as sacrament hymns: if you look up “Sacrament” in the topical index in the back of the hymnal, it is a list of all the hymns from 169–196, but it also includes these two.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them\n\n\nLet’s start with O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197). It was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every four years per ward on average. Given that it feels like a sacrament hymn and like an Easter hymn, it is perfectly placed between the more on-the-nose sacrament hymns (i.e. those about the bread and water) and the more traditional Easter hymns (e.g. He is Risen! (199)). Perhaps some music chairpeople noticed it in the Index and chose it because of that. But, I could see a music chairperson selecting it because they perhaps thought sacrament hymns went from 169–197 instead of 169–196.\nThe oddball though is Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146). In fact, it was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every two years per ward, which is just about as often as O Thou, Before the World Began (189). It is not clear to me why this one is listed in the index as a sacrament hymn, but it’s not grouped together with the other sacrament hymns. The “Prayer and Supplication” category of hymns, which is what this is a part of (and rightfully so, in my opinion), is just before the “Sacrament” category. If it, like O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197), fits into both categories, then I think it should be moved to hymn 168 so that it’s less out of left field. This one really should be thought of as an honorary sacrament hymn. Perhaps we’ll see it included in the “official” list of sacrament hymns in the next hymnal."

    "text": "Sacrament hymns sung elsewhere\nFinally, we can look at sacrament hymns that were sung at some other point in a sacrament meeting. Unsurprisingly, I Stand All Amazed (193) is at the top, being sung occasionally as an opening hymn and closing hymn. At only once every 6–7 years, it’s not particularly common to see it sung this way, but it’s still not unheard of. After that, there are a few others like Behold the Great Redeemer Die (191) and There Is a Green Hill Far Away (194) were also used as one of the other hymns, but it was still quite unusual.\nOverall, while singing a specific sacrament hymn elsewhere in the meeting is pretty unusual, the odds of singing any of the sacrament hymns is more common since their frequencies add together. It happened in 61 of the 5211 sacrament meetings I have data from, or 1.1% of them. That means, on average, a ward might since hymn 169–196 at some other point in the meeting approximately once every year and ten months."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe findings in this section suggest that were have a strong tradition of singing hymns 169 through 196 in our sacrament meetings immediately before the sacrament itself. Some wards systematically cycle through them, which I believe is a perfectly appropriate thing to do to include the widest variety of hymns to the ward. Other wards pick and choose, which inevitably leads to some favorites being sung more and some lesser-known ones falling through the cracks.\nAs we’ll see when we look at holidays, wards do not always stick to the table of contents at the beginning of the hymnal when choosing appropriate hymns. However, in the case of the sacrament—which is the most important part of our Sunday worship and the primary reason for Sunday gatherings—it’s clear that we adhere strongly to the recommendation. Nevertheless, the addition of Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) shows that there is at least some room for thinking out of the box when selecting sacrament hymns."

Given what was discussed previously about the sacrament hymns, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the most common hymn is a sacrament hymn. In fact, the top 15 most sung hymns are sacrament hymns. There is a fairly well-enforced constraint that at least one hymn per meeting “must” be one of the 28 canonical sacrament hymns (with two “honorary hymns” as possibilities as well). We can now better appreciate the list of the most common hymns."

    "text": "The mosts common hymns\nThe most common hymns sung in the church, according to my data, are displayed in Figure 1. Here, sacrament hymns are in gray and other hymns are in black. I’ve shown only the hymns that are sung, on average, one or more times per year per ward. We see a nice list of 22 hymns that are probably well-known by most members of the church. They are generic enough to be appropriate for most meetings. Their message is centered on Christ and other foundational tenents of our religion. Some are more common around certain holidays, like Come, Come Ye Saints (30) around Pioneer Day in Utah or Love At Home (294) around Mother’s Day, but they’re also general enough to be appropriate at other times of the year as well. Thus, what we see in Figure 1 is a solid list of the most popular hymns in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.You may think that a lot of hymns that pertain to specific holidays would make it onto this list, but as we’ll see in later blog posts about annual trends, there are actually relatively few festive hymns that are sung by most wards most years.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The “favorites”: Hymns that are sung at least once per year\n\n\nFigure 1 also shows how common each of these hymns are. Many sacrament hymns are sung, on average, more than twice a year. (Keep in mind that there are only 48 sacrament meetings per year, and 28 sacrament hymns to choose from, so many will have to double up.) None of the non-sacrament hymns were sung, on average, more than twice a year. But the sheer fact that this plot exists—a display of all the hymns thare are sung at least once a year on average—means that some wards do sing them more than once a year.\nThis list of favorites is useful because if you are a new ward organist, these are the hymns to practice first. Learning these 22 hymns (plus the sacrament hymns) will get you the most mileage. In fact, these 46 hymns account for 43% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting in this sample. That means that if you learn the hymns shown in Figure 1, you’ll be able to play almost half of the meetings in your ward.\n\nAre these the “standards”?\nIt is interesting to compare this list of “favorites” to the list in the back of the hymnal under the section “Hymns for Stake Conference” (page 381). That section lists “standard, well-known hymns” and it is implied that many members would have these hymns memorized. Interestingly, there is not a lot of overlap between these lists. Figure 2 shows which hymns appear in Figure 1 and are usually sung more than once a year (excluding sacrament hymns), and which are the “standards” listed in the back of the hymnal. This time, the hymns in purple are ones that are recommended as “standards” and are indeed sung pretty regularly. The blue ones are what are sung pretty often but are not one of “the standards” listed in the back of the hymnal. The red ones are recommended “standards” that are not as popular. Most of lesser-popular “standards” are still sung pretty regularly, usually at least once every two years. The exception is Come, O Thou King of Kings (59), which is sung less than once every two years and is not what I would consider to be a popular hymn.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Standard vs. Popular hymns. Here, “standard” means they’re recommended in the back of the hymnal as a well-known hymn. “Popular” means they’re sung more than once a year according to this sample. Sacrament hymns are excluded.\n\n\nHowever, it should be kept in mind that this isn’t exactly a fair comparison. For one, this list of “standards” is what is recommended for stake conference, which is not the same as sacrament meeting. Also, this list printed in the back of the hymnal is presumably what was recommended in 1985 when this hymnal was first published. What is considered a standard has surely changed in the past few decades. Furthermore, many of the currently most popular hymns were new additions to the 1985 hymnal, including Because I Have Been Given Much (219), I Believe in Christ (134), I Am a Child of God (301), and Called to Serve (249). It makes sense that they’re not recommended in the back of the hymnal because they were brand new when that list was published! How could they have know they’d be so popular? My recommendation for the church would be to update the list of stake conference recommendations to include these most popular hymns and to remove the ones that are less common today."

But if your ward doesn’t systematically cycle through the hymns though, it’s sung only about once every three years. 5/n\nIn the “Sacrament” section of the topic index, it lists two additional hymns: “O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown” (197) and “Gently Raise the Sacred Strain” (146). The first one is more Eastery and the second is more “Prayer and Supplication”-y, so that makes sense. 6/n\n“O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown” (197) was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every four years. “Gently Raise the Sacred Strain” (146) was about once every two years, which is more than some “official” sacrament hymns! 7/n INSERT IMAGE\nVery occasionally, a ward will sing a sacrament hymn as the opening, closing, or intermediate hymn. This is most common with “I Stand All Amazed” (193). Across all 28 hymns, it happens about 1.1% of the time, or once every 22 months in a given ward, on average. 8/n\nIn conclusion, it appears that we stick pretty close to the “rules” about that second hymn in sacrament meeting. Some wards cycle through while others pick and choose. Some are favorites and some are less common and two are “honorary” members of the group. 9/9\nYou can read more about these findings at https://hymnstats.joeystanley.com/findings.html#sacrament-hymns.

In fact, the top 15 most common hymns are sacrament hymns. If we disregard those, the most common hymn is “I Know that My Redeemer Lives (136).” 1/n INSERT FIGURE\nThe top three most popular hymns are “I Know That My Redeemer Lives (136),” “How Firm a Foundation (85),” and “Because I Have Been Given Much (219).” Each of these are sung, on average, at least 1.5 times per year per ward. That seems low, but that’s what the data show. 2/n\nOther popular hymns include “Lord, I Would Follow Thee (220),” and “I Believe in Christ (134),” “High on the Mountain Top (5),” “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19),” and “Now Let Us Rejoice (3),” which are each sung every 9.5 months or so, on average, per ward. 3/n\nAnother 14 hymns are sung, on average, more than once per year per ward, not including sacrament hymns. 4/n\nInterestingly, the back of the hymnbook has a list of “standard” hymns that presumably everyone knows that would be good for stake conference. Only about half of those “standard” hymns are actually sung more than once a year. 5/n INSERT IMAGE\nThe fact that the standard hymns aren’t the same as the popular ones means that what we consider our favorites has shifted in the past 38 years since the hymnal came out. I personally wouldn’t consider “Come, O Thou King of Kings (59)” as particularly popular. 6/n\nYou can read more about these findings at https://hymnstats.joeystanley.com/posts/most_common_hymns.html.
