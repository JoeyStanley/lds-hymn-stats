    "text": "Welcome to the LDS Hymn Stats project! The purpose of this project is to discover what hymns are most commonly sung generally and in certain times of the year in sacrament meetings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have gathered data on what hymns were sung in 25,638 sacrament meetings from 1,293 wards."

    "text": "Project Overview\nHave you ever wondered what the most common hymn is in sacrament meeting? I can tell you right now: it’s I Stand All Amazed (193) and it’s sung, on average, once every 4.6 months in a given ward. What hymn is least common? Well, that’s a trickier question to answer, but if you ignore the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal, some of the least common hymns in sacrament meeting are Sons of Michael, He Approaches (51), This House We Dedicate to Thee (245), Go, Ye Messengers of Glory (262), and God Save the King (341).\nWhat is the most popular Christmas hymn? It looks like it’s Joy to the World (201). If that matches your intuition, then that’s good news because it’s means I’ve got good data! But, what is the most popular Mother’s Day hymn? Thanksgiving? Valentine’s Day?\nWith this project, I have been able to answer some of these simpler questions, but I’ve also been able to uncover some subtler patterns as well. Like, what Christmas hymns are typically sung the third Sunday in December? (The First Noel (213) might be the most likely.) On the Sunday after Thanksgiving (in the United States), do people sing more Thanksgiving hymns, Christmas hymns, or neither? Are there “unofficial” sacrament hymns that are sung more than any of the “official” ones? What percentage of wards outside of Utah (but still in the US) sing Pioneer Day hymns around Pioneer Day?\nI’ve also uncovered some of what might go through a music coordinator’s head as they select what hymns are to be sung in their ward. It seems like the more popular Christmas hymns are reserved for Sundays when it is anticipated that the most number of people will be in attendance, and the less popular ones are used during peak travel dates. Even though the entry for “Thanksgiving” in topic index in the back of the hymnal directs readers to the “Gratitude” for more hymns, very few people actually use those gratitude-themed hymns around Thanksgiving. Easter hymns trump both General Conference– and Fast Sunday–themed hymns in April, and Fourth of July trumps Fast Sunday hymns.\nFurthermore, I’ve been able to uncover patterns that say something interesting about Mormon culture. For example, Mother’s Day hymns are typically about earthly mothers while Father’s Day hymns are about Heavenly Father. Enough Utahns have relocated to other parts of the US that Pioneer Day may be considered a de facto LDS holiday. And a decent number of wards systematically cycle through the 28 sacrament hymns, sometimes for years without any deviation. And many wards sing Called to Serve (#249) during missionary farewells, which happen more in the summer.\nAs a secondary part of this project, I’m also addressing questions about the music of the hymns. What hymn has the highest melody note? Well, if you exclude the women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal and the optional note at the end of Carry On (255), it’s the F# in the rarely-sung Lean on My Ample Arm (120). What part has the narrowest range? What is the most common key signature? How many hymns could you sing the tenor line for if you can only go up to a Bb? What is the most common final chord? How many hymns don’t end on “do”? How many add9 chords are there in the hymnal?"

    "text": "What hymns are sung?\nFigure 1 shows the most popular congregational hymns between December 26th and January 7th. I’ve color-coded the hymn names to correspond to the holiday they are most closely associated with. Hymns 201–214 are Christmas hymns and are colored in red. Hymns 215 and 217 are New Year’s hymns and are colored in blue. Everything else is colored in gray.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Most popular congregational hymns the two Sundays after Christmas\n\n\n\n\nIt’s apparent that it is quite popular to sung New Year’s hymns the Sunday after Christmas. Almost 50% of wards sing Come, Let Us Anew (#217) and about 44% sing Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215). There is also a clear stand out for the most most popular Christmas hymn during this week, which is I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day (#215), but only about 17% of wards sing it the Sunday after Christmas.\nWhat is interesting is that We Are Sowing (#216) made it on this chart. It’s not a New Year’s hymn (it’s not listed as one in topics index), but it is, for some reason, sandwiched between the two that are. What seems like is happening is that it gets lumped in by association. Unsurprising, but pretty interesting that it happens enough to show up on the plot.\nBut, you might argue that the week after Christmas is a totally different Sunday than the week after New Year’s. And you’d be right! If we break the data down into those two weeks, we get very different pictures! @fig_limbo shows the most popular hymns just in the last week of December. You can see that while the New Year’s hymns are still at the top, all the rest are all Christmas hymns. And if you look closely, Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215) is the more common of the two New Year’s hymns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Most popular congregational hymns December 26th–31st\n\n\n\n\nIf we now look at the first Sunday in January, we get a totally different picture. Figure 3 shows that once we’re on the January side of New Year’s, no Christmas hymn is popular. We again get the New Year’s hymns, but all the other hymns are just generic popular hymns without much of a theme.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Most popular congregational hymns January 1st–7th\n\n\n\n\nSo, while this blog post is intending to cover both of these weeks at the same time, it’s important to separate them out as best I can."

The bottom left cell shows that 28.2% of wards sing at least one New Year’s hymn and no Christmas hymns. It is interesting that these numbers are so similar even, so even though the two blue bars in Figure 2 above were much longer, the many shorter red bars add up to be about the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Percentage of wards that sing Thanksgiving and Christmas hymns the\nSunday after Thanksgiving \n  \n    \n    \n      Christmas hymns\n      \n        New Year's hymns\n      \n    \n    \n      yes\n      no\n    \n  \n  \n    yes\n18.1%\n34.6%\n    no\n28.2%\n19.1%\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the numbers in the other corners of the box are also pretty even. About 18.1% of wards sing both Christmas and New Year’s hymns, while 19.1% of wards sing neither. And if we add up the rows and the columns, they all come close to about 50%. Here’s a (maybe confusing) summary of what’s happening:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nAbout half of the wards sing Christmas hymns and half don’t. Of the ones that do, about a third also sing New Year’s hymns. Of the one’s that don’t, about a third also do not sing New Year’s hymns.\n\n\nThe amazing thing is that if you swap Christmas and New Year’s in all those statements, it’s still true!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunner Fact\n\n\n\nAbout half of the wards sing New Year’s hymns and half don’t. Of the ones that do, about a third also sing Christmas hymns. Of the one’s that don’t, about a third also do not sing Christmas hymns.\n\n\nI find the symmetry in those results very satisfying.\nI took a look at the wards that didn’t sing either Christmas or New Year’s hymns the last week of December and I didn’t see too much about what hymns they did sing. There were a few that I could see fitting with the theme of the closing of a year, like God Be With You Till We Meet Again (#152), The Time is Far Spent (#266), The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37), Sing We Now at Parting (#156), Lord, Dismiss Us with Thy Blessing (#163), Lord, We Ask Thee Ere We Part (#153), and Now the Day Is Over (#159). Another theme was people choosing “forward looking” hymns like Go Forth with Faith (#263), Let Us All Press On (#243), Onward, Christian Soldiers (#246), Put Your Shoulder to the Wheel (#252). Personally, I appreciate the thought behind the selection of these hymns. Unfortunately, they are just not common enough to show up on any of these plots.\nThe other pattern, singing both a Christmas hymn and a New Year’s hymn, is just as common as singing neither. Like what we saw for the week after Thanksgiving, there does seem to be a pattern though for when within the meeting these Christmas and New Year’s hymns are sung. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most common configuration is for the opening hymn to be a Christmas hymn and the closing hymn to be a New Year’s hymn. That happened in 90% of the wards I have data from that sang both hymn types in the same meeting. Of those, the most sang some other hymn as the intermediate hymn, then Christmas, then New Year’s. The other configurations I have attestations of are shown in Table 2 and only showed up once or twice.

    "text": "New Year’s Day\nLike what we saw with the Sunday after Thanksgiving, there is an effect that the actual date has on the hymns. Specifically, if that Sunday lands on December 1st, the numnber of Christmas hymns goes up quite a bit. Do we see the same kind of pattern with New Year’s Day?\nProbably unsurprisingly, yes! Figure 4 shows the breakdown of Christmas, New Year’s and other hymns from December 26th through January 7th.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Proportion of Christmas, New Year’s, and Other hymns by date\n\n\n\n\nI think this is a largely unsurprising pattern. First, we see that the number of Christmas hymns decreases the further you get from Christmas. In secular American Christmas culture, it seems like the Christmas season ends sometime between Christmas and New Year’s. However, in some Christian traditions, they do honor the fact that the “twelve days of Christmas” starts on Christmas day, meaning it extends until January 5th, with various celebrations happening after that, like Epiphany on the 6th. In my experience (keeping mind that I’m not an expert in Mormon culture), the end of the Christmas season for Latter-day Saints is in-line with mainstream American culture and happens pretty soon after the 25th. This plot shows pretty strong evidence for that: there was no indication of Christmas hymns being sung during the last three days of Christmas.\nThe second pattern we see is the rise and fall of the popularity of New Year’s hymns. The closer you are to New Year’s Eve—and yes, it appears to peak on New Year’s Eve—the more likely you are to sing New Year’s hymns.\nFinally, all the other hymns gradually become more common as you progress from December 26th to January 7th. It’s actually quite a straight line, so there doesn’t appear to be a jump at any one point.\nSo, when looking at the transition from Thanksgiving to Christmas, there was an abrupt pivot point at December 1st. In this case, there is no such abrupt change. Instead, we gradually transition away from Christmas, into New Year’s, and away from both over the course of two weeks. I think this is quite a cool pattern to see because, as far as I’m aware, this is almost entirely unconscious. I don’t think any music coordinator looks at their notes from previous years and thinks, “well, this year, we’re one day further to New Year’s than we were last year, so I’ll lower the odds of choosing a New Year’s hymn by 5%.” But, when aggregating many wards over many years, the pattern is pretty tidy.\nI should mention that seeing the trend shown in Figure 4 is only possible because I have data spanning over 20 years. Since the the Sundays around New Year’s Day fall on different dates, I can compare those days to each other. So, for example, in 2024, New Year’s Day will be on a Monday, so Sunday will be New Year’s Eve. This was also true in 2007 and 2018, so that column represents those three years pooled together. I think this is important to mention because no matter how much data is collected from one year, you’ll still only see just one of these columns. It takes a lot of data over many years to be able to see this kind of nuance.\nTo dig just a little deeper, I wanted to see the trends for specific hymns across these dates. In Figure 5 (sorry for the small text), each of the 14 Christmas hymns and two New Year’s Hymns is in their own panel. Lines and dots are higher if that hymn is sung more often on that day.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Christmas and New Year’s hymn frequencies, Dec 26 through Jan 7\n\n\n\n\nAmong the New Year’s hymns, we again see that Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215) is more common in December and that Come, Let Us Anew (#217) is more common in January. Among the Christmas hymns, there’s nothing that really stands out. Each hymn has its own story of course, but it’s nothing that we haven’t already seen when looking at Christmas hymns over the course of December.A \\(\\chi^2\\) test suggests that this difference—that Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215) is more common before New Year’s and Come, Let Us Anew (#217) is more common after—is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 8.78, df = 1, p = 0.002). This may be another case where the order that they appear in the hymnal influences when they’re sung.\nFinally, just to dig a even deeper, Figure 6 shows when the two New Year’s hymns are sung within Sacrament meeting. Because intermediate hymns are not common, it’s no surprise that their bars are smaller. And it’s highly unusual to sing these as sacrament hymns, but apparently it has been done.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: When New Year’s hymns are sung in Sacrament meeting\n\n\n\n\nI’ve split the data up by month because I thought there might be a difference, and it turns out I was right. Come, Let Us Anew (#217) is about equally likely to be sung as an opening hymn or a closing hymn, regardless of whether it’s before New Year’s or after, with maybe a slight preference for it as an opening hymn in January. But Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215) is far more common as a closing hymn in December and as an opening hymn in January.  I think the general idea is that New Year’s hymns are most common in the slot closest to New Year’s itself, so since closing hymns in December are closer to New Year’s, you sing them last, and since opening hymns are closer in January, you sing them as opening hymns.Once again, a \\(\\chi^2\\) test suggests that this difference in when Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215) is sung in the meeting is statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2\\) = 29.56, df = 1, p &lt; 0.001)."

Other hymns gradually become more and more common so that by the time the twelve days of Christmas are over, almost all congregations have transitioned completely away from either holiday."

By this, I mean that, if a hymn is in the key of G major, are there hymns that do not end on a G? As it turns out, there are 16 of them!\nTwelve of these 16 hymns end on the third of the chord. The most common is Thy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188), which is a sacrament hymn, albeit one of the lesser common ones. Most of the others are not unusual and they include ones like The First Noel (#298), Secret Prayer (#225), and Master, the Tempest Is Raging (#105).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First Noel (#213)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimony (#137)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Know My Father Lives (#302)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecret Prayer (#144)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod Speed the Right (#106)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (#197)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster, the Tempest Is Raging (#105)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, May My Soul Commune with Thee (123)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Ever Pray for Thee (#23)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLean on My Ample Arm (#120)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Ever Pray for Thee (312)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other four hymns end on the fifth of the chord. We get another sacrament hymn, While of These Emblems We Partake (#173), as well as Carry On (#255), Does the Journey Seem Long? (#127), and Now the Day Is Over (#159).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile of These Emblems We Partake (#173)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarry On (#255)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the Journey Seem Long?

But, because a few sacrament hymns are on this list, as well as several relatively well-known hymns, it’s not a terribly unusual thing to see. In fact, you’re likely to see one of these 16 hymns about once every six weeks or so."

What is more interesting is the two middle parts. The alto line is nearly evenly split between ending on the tonic, the third note of the scale, or the fifth note of the scale, with a very slight preference for the root. Meanwhile, the tenor line ends on the third 64% of the time, and is otherwise evenly split between the root and the fifth.

In some hymns, at least one part sustains its last note while at least one other part resolves a chord or moves in some other way. There are eight hymns that do this.\nTwo of these hymns, He Died! The Great Redeemer Died (#192) and As the Shadows Fall (#168) end with a Sus4 chord resolving to the tonic chord, with the tenor line responsible for the resolution. The latter of those two has a fifth in the chord, creating some nice close harmony between the tenor and alto line, while the former lacks the fifth and has a more open sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe Died!

In Keep the Commandments (#303), the two inner lines move down and then back up to return to the original notes. In Behold! A Royal Army (#251), they both jump up a fourth and then back down a second, creating a different voicing of the tonic chord than what they started on. In the case of Come unto Jesus (#117), the alto line has a little passing tone.I don’t know enough about music theory to say for sure of the penultimate chord in Keep the Commandments (#303) is a subdominant or something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep the Commandments (#303)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehold!

    "title": "What are the most common final chords?",
    "section": "Final chords",
    "text": "Final chords\nWe now turn to the topic of the final chords themselves, rather than individual parts or notes. As established already, all hymns end in a major or minor chord, so the only options are roots, thirds, and fifths of chords. Logically, there are \\(3\\times 3\\times 3\\times 3=81\\) possible ways to use those three notes, if you ignore octave differences and good musical taste. Of course, the hymnal uses far fewer than that.Since two of the five hymns set in a minor key end in picardy thirds, there are only two hymns that truly end in a minor chord.\nLet me pause briefly to explain the notation I’ll be using. I’ll describe the voicing of the chord using the numbers 1, 3, or 5, from lowest (bass) to highest (soprano). So if we’re in the key of C major, 1-5-3-1 would mean the basses are on a C3, the tenors a G3 above that, the altos on an E4 above that, and the sopranos on a C5 above that. If a part sings in unison with the part below it, I replace its number with an asterisk. This figure shows the twelve configurations found in the hymnal, in order of frequency. Let’s dive into each one of these.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-3-1-* endings\nThe most common voicings to end a hymn on is 1-3-1-*. The bass line ends on the tonic, the tenor a third above, and the alto and soprano lines in unison on the root of the chord (an octave higher). The most common non-sacrament hymn to end on this voicing is Lord, I Would Follow Thee (#220), shown below.\n\n\n\nLord, I Would Follow Thee (#220)\n\n\nAlmost all the hymns that fit this 1-3-1-* description look just like Lord, I Would Follow Thee (#220), but two hymns are slightly different in that the bass note is down an octave. We get this in O My Father (#292) and The Voice of God Again Is Heard (#18).\n\n\n\nO My Father (#292)\n\n\nBecause there are 97 hymns that are voiced as 1-3-1-*, I’m not going to show all of them, but here is a plot that shows the most common ones and how often they are sung in a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we just look at the key signatures of the hymns that fall into this category, we get pretty much all of them. But when we arrange those key signatures in order, we see a pretty clear pattern. Basically, the key of D major is the ideal key to end with this chord, and the closer a key signature is to D, the more likely it is to also use this chord. For keys further away, you’re less likely to see this voicing. For whatever reason, it’s just not ideal to have a hymn in the key of G end with this voicing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lowest version of this voicing are the two hymns in the key of B♭ major, Silent Night (#204) and Joseph Smith’s First Prayer (#26) which are the lowest final notes for the soprano line and as mentioned already are among the lowest soprano notes in the hymnal. Meanwhile, the highest instance is in A♭ in The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37), making that A♭3 the highest note the alto line ends on and the A♭4 the highest final bass note (which probably explains the optional lower note).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Smith’s First Prayer (#26)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilent Night (#204)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow often are you likely to see this voicing? Well, since there are 97 hymns that fit this category, including many sacrament hymns, pretty likely. Based on the 17,833 sacrament meetings I have data from, 33.0% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting use this voicing, which means odds are pretty good that on any given Sunday, you’ll see at least one hymn ending in 1-3-1-*.\n\n\n1-3-5-1 endings\nThe 1-3-5-1 ending is basically tied for first place as the most common ending. In its most basic form, it’s a triad with the tonic repeated on top. 96 hymns end with this voicing. One of the most common non-sacrament ones is High on the Mountain Top (#5).\n\n\n\nHigh on the Mountain Top (#5)\n\n\n83 hymns look just like High on the Mountain Top (#5) above. But, like what we saw with 1-3-1-*, there is a subtype where the bass note is down an octave, creating a large interval between the bass and tenor notes. A common one is How Firm a Foundation (#85), which you can see below. Besides this one, there are another 14 hymns with this configuration.\n\n\n\nHow Firm a Foundation (#85)\n\n\nAgain, there are too many hymns that are 1-3-5-1, so I won’t show all of them. But here are plots that show the most common ones and how often they are sung in a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we just look at the key signatures of the hymns that fall into this category, we get 1-3-5-1 endings in most keys. While the 1-3-1-* voicing above appeared to be centered around D major, this one appears to be more common in slightly higher keys. The reason is likely the alto voice: anything lower would put it pretty low. In fact, the one instance in D♭ is in As the Shadows Fall (#168), which makes that A♭3 the lowest final note for the alto line in the hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Shadows Fall (#168)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the differences between the two types (whethe the bass note is high or low), we see that the low bass note version of 1-3-5-1 is most common among hymns in G major, with just a handful scattered among other keys. The one hymn that uses it in E♭ is Thy Holy Word (#279) and has the lowest bass note in the hymnal. The 1-3-5-1 final chord in B♭ also results in the highest final note for a tenor part, a D4 in Let Zion in Her Beauty Rise (#41).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThy Holy Word (#279)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet Zion in Her Beauty Rise (#41)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow often are you likely to see a 1-3-5-1 hymn? Again, there are many of them, including sacrament hymns, so it’s going to be pretty likely. Based on the 17,833 sacrament meetings I have data from, 31.5% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting use this voicing, which means odds are pretty good that, like 1-3-1-* discussed already, you’ll see at least one hymn ending in 1-3-3-5 on any given Sunday.\n\n\n1-1-3-1 endings\nThe next most common way to end a hymn is to use the 1-1-3-1 voicing. The bass, tenor, and soprano line are in three octaves, and the alto line sings the third of the chord below the soprano line. The most common non-sacrament hymn to end on this voicing is For the Beauty of the Earth (#93), shown below.\n\n\n\nFor the Beauty of the Earth (#93)\n\n\nA related ending is the one instance 1-*-1-3 in the hymn Thy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188). That C3 in the tenors is the lowest final tenor note in the hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188)\n\n\n\n\n54 hymns end in 1-1-3-1, so again, I’m not going to show all of them, but this plot shows how often the most common ones are sung in a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the key signatures of the hymns that end in this voicing, we see basically the opposite pattern from 1-3-1-* above. The hymns that use the 1-1-3-1 voicing are mostly in the G, A♭, B♭ range.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lowest iteration of 1-1-3-1 is in F major, which is found in six hymns, three of which are Christmas hymns. The highest version is in C major, as in The Morning Breaks (#1).\nSince there are fewer of these hymns, the odds of seeing them is slightly lower. They made up 15.8% of the dataset that I have, so you’ll likely to sing one about every two weeks.\n\n\n1-5-3-1 endings\nThe final type of final chord that has a significant presence in the hymnal is 1-5-3-1. It also spans two octaves, like other endings, but the voices are more evenly spaced. In my mind, this is the “Ice Cream” voicing because in The Music Man, it’s the chord that the barbershop quartet sings when Herold Hill is teaching them to sing for the first time and he gets them to sing sustained notes while saying “ice cream.” We see this voicing at the end of 42 hymns, including Now Let Us Rejoice (#3).\n\n\n\nNow Let Us Rejoice (#3)\n\n\nI should mention too that Ye Elders of Israel (#319) fits into this category, but the alto is voiced above the soprano line (and thus making it truer to how barbershop is typically voiced).\n\n\n\nNow Let Us Rejoice (#319)\n\n\nHere are the most common hymns that fit this category, sorted by how often they’re sung per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the other final chords we’ve examined so far, it seems like there are some key signatures in which they’re more common. In the case of 1-5-3-1, it’s most common in B♭ major and C major, but we do get it in a handful of other keys as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one hymn in the key of E♭ is What Was Witnessed in the Heavens? (#11). This is the highest version of this chord, and it means the soprano line ends on an E♭5, the highest final soprano note in the hymnal. The lowest version of this chord is in the key of F in We’re Not Ashamed to Own Our Lord (#57), which makes that C4 in the tenors the lowest final tenor note in the hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Was Witnessed in the Heavens? (#11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re Not Ashamed to Own Our Lord (#57)\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there are only 42 of these hymns, again, the odds of seeing them is lower. They made up 11.0% of the dataset that I have, so you’ll likely to sing one about every two or three weeks.\n\n\nNon-tonic soprano final chords\nThe remaining final chord voices are all pretty unusual and are only found in a handful of hymns. We’ve already seen that 16 hymns end the soprano line something other than the tonic and that all hymns end the bass line on the tonic. Of those 16, there are four different voicings. Here, we’ll ignore briefly the two that don’t have full SATB harmonies.\nNine hymns end with 1-5-1-3: We Ever Pray for Thee (#23), Master, the Tempest Is Raging (#105), God Speed the Right (#106), Lean on My Ample Arm (#120), Oh, May My Soul Commune with Thee (#123), Testimony (#137), Secret Prayer (#144), O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (#197), and The First Noel (#213). There is only one other hymn that ends with the melody on the third, Thy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188) and it has a 1-*-1-3 voicing.I won’t post images of the hymns since these are all shown already.\nOf the hymns that have the melody end on the fifth, there are two voicing configurations. Three hymns use the 1-3-1-5 voicing: Does the Journey Seem Long? (#127), While of These Emblems We Partake (#173), and Carry On (#255). Finally, Now the Day Is Over (159) ends with 1-1-3-5.\n\n\nDuets and Unisons\nA few hymns have specific instructions to sing it as a duet or in unison. I’ll probably do a more thorough treatment of those hymns in a later blog post, but for now, we’ll just focus on how they end.\nThough seven hymns begin as duets, five of them go into full harmony partway through. They are Jesus, Lover of My Soul (#102), I Stand All Amazed (#193), Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd (#221), Let Us Oft Speak Kind Words (#232), and Truth Reflects upon Our Senses (#273). However, two hymns are duets the whole way through. Keep the Commandments (#303) ends in a 3-1 voicing. The other is Love One Another (#308) which is marked as a duet, but at the end breaks into three parts (3-5-1).\nFinally, we get to the hymns that have at least some portion marked as unison. The hymns Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (#118), I Know That My Redeemer Lives (#136), Behold! A Royal Army (#251), and Carry On (#255), start in unison and then break into harmony, so they’ve been discussed above where appropriate. Called to Serve (#249) starts in harmony and then goes to unison. Other stay unison throughout the entirety of the hymn. Come, Rejoice (#9), As Zion’s Youth in Latter Days (#256), Families Can Be Together Forever (#300), I Know My Father Lives (#302), Teach Me to Walk in the Light (#304), God’s Daily Care (#306), and The Priesthood of Our Lord (#320) all end on the tonic while I Know My Father Lives (#302) ends on the third."

A handful of hymns end with at least one moving part. There are four main final chords the hymnbook uses, with most of the exceptions being from non-tonic-ending soprano lines, duets, and unisons. These main four tend to be used more with certain key signatures, summarized in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I think is coolest finding—and maybe this is old news for musicologists and choral arrangers—is that the final chord voicing is somewhat predictable by the key signature. Hymns in the D♭–d range are often 1-3-1-*, hymns in the E♭–G range are often 1-3-5-1, hymns in the A♭–B♭ range are often 1-1-3-1, and while never the majority, hymns in the B♭–C range are often 1-5-3-1."

    "text": "What key signature is most common in the hymnal?\nIt doesn’t take any specialized skills to figure out what key signature is the most common, nothing more than flipping through the hymnal and tallying the key signatures up. To save you a sacrament meeting distraction, I went ahead did this for you, and Figure 1 shows the distribution of key signatures across the hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Frequency of key signatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe most common key signature is G major, or one sharp.\n\n\nIf you know the hymnal well, nothing about Figure 1 should come as a surprise. The modern hymnal tends to use key signatures that have few sharps or flats. There are about as many hymns in the D major as there are in C major and E♭ major. There are slightly fewer hymns in F and B♭ major for some reason. E♭ major is the standout because even though it has more flats than B♭ and F, it outnumbers those two. In general though, the further in the circle of fourths you go away from G major, the fewer hymns there are.That wasn’t necessarily true of previous versions. For example, some hymns in the previous version (the blue hymnal) were in the key of E major with four sharps. Presumably they got rid of those because they were too hard for some accompanists to play.\nTwo key signatures are marginal in the hymnal. The key of A major, with three sharps, is only found in two hymns: the men’s chorus arrangement of An Angel from on High (#328) and How Wondrous and Great (#267). Since the first is a men’s chorus arrangement, it was never sung in sacrament meeting in my data. The second was sung about once every 4ish years, so a less common hymn for sure, but more common than many others.\nThe other marginal key signature is D♭ and, again, just two hymns are in that key. As the Shadows Fall (#168) was sung just 11 times in my data, or once every roughly 35 years. The other, Softly Beams the Sacred Dawning (#56), was sung just five times in my sample, meaning it’s sung about once every 76 years. Because of how unusual these hymns are, these numbers are very rough guesses; perhaps we can think of them as “once in a generation” and “once in a lifetime.” The point is, it is very unusual to sing a hymn in D♭.\nFor what it’s worth, there is one hymn that actually changes keys partway though. Welcome, Welcome, Sabbath Morning (#280) starts in C major, shifts to G major, and then back to C major. For the purposes of this study, I’m treating it as being in C major the entire time."

    "text": "But do we actually see G major the most?\nSo we’ve addressed the question of what key signature the most number of hymns are set to. But, does that actually mean that’s the most that we see? What’s the difference? It may be the case that tons of hymns in G major are really obscure ones that hardly anyone ever sees. So, if we take frequency into account, perhaps another key is seen more often, even if fewer hymns are actually in it.\n(An analogy here is that Figure 1 is like the Senate: equal representation of all states, regardless of population. In this case, all hymns are treated equally, regardless of how often they’re sung. Figure 2 is like the House of Representatives: representation based on population, or in this case, how often a hymn is sung.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Frequency of key signatures, weighted based on hymn popularity\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 looks similar to Figure 1 except I’ve adjusted the heights of the bars based on how frequent each hymn is. If a hymn is more common, it’ll raise the bar for its key signature more. If it’s less common, it’ll raise it less.\nWhile superficially the two plots may look similar, there are some important differences. (See Table 1 as well.) First, D major is closer in height to G major. While only about 16.5% of the hymns are in D, they’re sung about 18.3% of the time. This is likely due to some pretty common sacrament hymns like Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (#196), O God, the Eternal Father (#175), and In Memory of the Crucified (#190) as well as some other heavy hitters like I Believe in Christ (#134) and We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (#19).\nMost of the other key signatures are pretty similar. C major and F major are more or less unchanged. Though 11.47% of hymns are set in B♭ major, they’re only sung about 10.34% of the time. And while A♭ major is only used in 5.59% of the hymns, it’s sung 4.85% of the time in sacrament meeting. (No doubt, I Stand All Amazed (#193) is doing the lion’s share of the work there.)\nPerhaps the biggest change is that E♭ is a bit more commonly seen than you’d expect based on how many hymns there are in it. 14.41% of hymns are in E♭, but 16.91% of the hymns actually sung in sacrament meeting are in E♭. Undoubtedly, it’s because nine of the 28 sacrament hymns are in E♭. So, to put it another way, on average, hymns in E♭ major are more common than hymns in C major or even B♭ major.\nFinally, the fact that the keys of A and D♭ major are mere slivers in Figure 2 reflects what was explained above that they’re really uncommon.\nFigure 2 probably has the most useful application out of anything else in this blog post. If you’re a budding musician and are still getting used to key signatures, the good news is that you don’t have to learn all twelve keys to play the hymnal. If you focus your efforts on hymns in G, D, and E♭, you’ll get the most mileage out of your practice.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Key signature frequencies\n\n\nKey Signature\n# of hymns\n% of hymnal\n% of hymns sung\n\n\n\n\nA\n2\n0.59%\n0.14%\n\n\nD\n56\n16.47%\n18.17%\n\n\nG\n76\n22.35%\n21.59%\n\n\nC\n49\n14.41%\n14.15%\n\n\nF\n48\n14.12%\n13.89%\n\n\nBb\n39\n11.47%\n10.30%\n\n\nEb\n49\n14.41%\n16.96%\n\n\nAb\n19\n5.59%\n4.77%\n\n\nDb\n2\n0.59%\n0.02%"

    "section": "Why is G major the most common?",
    "text": "Why is G major the most common?\nI’m not a musicologist, but I can speculate as to why G is more common than C. It may be the case that many melodies are centered around the tonic, and extend roughly a fifth above it and roughly a fourth or fifth below it, with a total range of about an octave. If that’s the case, and a comfortable octave for many singers is from D to D, that means the key of G would be an appropriate key signature. A good example of this is Love One another (#308), in the left panel of Figure 3, which shows the distribution of notes in the melody, with the tonic highlighted in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Soprano ranges for two representative hymns\n\n\nOther melodies also span a full octave but the highest and lowest notes are the tonic itself. A good example of this is All Creatures of Our God and King (#62), the right panel of Figure 3. For melodies such as these, a key signature like D (or in this case, E♭) would be more appropriate so that the melody does not go too high or too low.\nSo, it may be the case then that the reason why G major is the most common key is because there are more melodies like Love One another (#308) than like All Creatures of Our God and King (#62). (Looking through plots like what you see in Figure 3, but for all the hymns in the key of G, it seems like pretty much all of them look similar to Love One another (#308).)\nAlong similar lines, if a piece is set to the key of G, the basses get to end the piece on a strong low note that many men, particularly men who sing bass lines, can hit. It’s nice to end a piece with the tonic being the lowest note of the bass line, and the entire hymn. Some examples of these hymns include Do What is Right (#237) (shown in the left panel of Figure 4) and God, Our Father, Hear Us Pray (#170). Other hymns, such as those set in C major or B♭ major, have the dominant (or fifth note of the scale) as the lowest note of the bass line, sometimes near the very end of the piece, like in Silent Night (#203) (shown in the right panel of Figure 4) or The Spirit of God (#2). While dropping down to a low dominant (in this case F if it’s in the key of B♭) can be a nice way to close a piece, I think a stronger finish is to end with the lowest note being the dominant, hence the greater number of hymns set in the key of G.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Bass ranges for two representative hymns"

    "text": "What about minor keys?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nExactly five hymns are set in a minor key.\n\n\nYou can see the five hymns in a minor key in Figure 5. The most common is the New Year’s Day hymn, Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215). We’ll talk more about holidays later on, but it’s only sung by 45% of wards around New Year’s Day. The next most common is If You Could Hie to Kolob (#284) although it’s not especially frequent and is only sung about once every 3.1 years or so. Third is That Easter Morn (#198) which, from my intuition, is punching above its weight because only 22% of wards sing it around Easter. The last two, Lord, We Come Before Thee Now (#162) and How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True? (#126) are pretty unusual and are sung about once every 16 years and once every 53 years or so, respectively.Although, if your ward ever does one of those musical testimony meetings where people get up and say what their favorite hymn is and then everyone sings a verse of that, I suspect you’re pretty much guaranteed to sing it then.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Frequency of hymns in a minor key\n\n\n\n\nSo, if you sing a hymn in a minor key, it’s probably one of the two holiday ones or If You Could Hie to Kolob (#284). I can’t help but think that the reason If You Could Hie to Kolob (#284) is so popular is because it’s set in a minor key. It’s a pretty obscure piece of doctrine that it’s talking about and I wonder if it were set to a different tune if it’d be as popular. In other words, do people like it because of the words or because of the music? Also, for what it’s worth, the distribution of notes looks very much like Love One another (#308) (the left panel in Figure 3).In fact, it was set to a different tune, in a major key, in the 1948 hymnal. It’s hymn #257. I don’t know how popular it was prior to 1985 though."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is the second week since new hymns were introduced! There was a little less hype about it online and I didn’t do as much petitioning (i.e begging) for data, but I did manage to get data from 65 wards. Last week, we saw that a little less than half of wards introduced new hymns, with about two thirds of those singing Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing (#1001). Let’s see how things changed for week 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that this blog post will update as I collect more data. I originally collected data about June 9th from 39 wards when I first published this post. I now have 65. As more come in, we’ll have a more accurate view of what happened.\n\n\nSo, while only abut a third of wards sang new hymns on June 2, it looks like there were fewer that sang a new one during week 2. It looks like a little over a quarter of wards sang at least one new hymn during this second week. This figure below shows these numbers and how they have changed from June 2nd to June 9th.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are lots of reasons for this drop. Many wards appear to be resistant to new hymns entirely, either because they don’t want to introduce them or perhaps because they are not aware of their release. For 44 wards, I have data from both June 2nd and Jun 9th. Around half of them didn’t introduce new hymns either week. About a third introduced a new hymn during one of the two weeks. The rest introduced a new hymn both weeks. Perhaps people were so anxious to sing Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing (#1001) and once they got that out of the way, then they decided to ease the rest of them in a little bit, possibly to give the organist time to practice.\nLast time, we saw that Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing (#1001) was far and away the most popular on June 2nd. Is that how it was on June 9th too? As explained already, I have less data and fewer wards sang new hymns, so it’s hard to say for sure. But the preliminary results are that Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing (#1001) was indeed the most popular, but not quite as much. This time, only roughly a third of wards sang it, compared to two thirds on June 2nd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      What new hymns were sung on June 9, 2024?\n    \n    \n      Based on the wards that sang new hymns\n    \n    \n      new hymn\n      wards\n      proportion\n    \n  \n  \n    Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing (1001)\n9\n47.4%\n    As Bread is Broken (1007)\n2\n10.5%\n    Bread of Life, Living Water (1008)\n2\n10.5%\n    His Eye Is on the Sparrow (1005)\n2\n10.5%\n    It Is Well with My Soul (1003)\n2\n10.5%\n    Gethsemane (1009)\n1\n5.3%\n    When the Savior Comes Again (1002)\n1\n5.3%\n    I Will Walk with Jesus (1004)\n0\n0.0%\n    Think a Sacred Song (1006)\n0\n0.0%\n    Hail the Day that Sees Him Rise (1201)\n0\n0.0%\n    He Is Born, the Divine Christ Child (1202)\n0\n0.0%\n    What Child is This? (1203)\n0\n0.0%\n    Star Bright (1204)\n0\n0.0%\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nIf we compare these proportions to last week, we can get a glimpse into some trends. The figure below shows what proportion of wards sang what hymns each week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest change is the drop in Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing (#1001). That makes sense because it was so popular during the first week. Pretty much all other hymns had an increase from June 2nd to June 9th. I think this shows that people were anxious to sing Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing (#1001) and once they got that out of the way, they felt at more liberty to try some of the other ones.\nAs for when during the meeting these new hymns were introduced, it’s hard to say for sure with such sparse data, but there again seems to be a trend of singing new hymns towards the ends of meetings, with the exception of course of sacrament hymns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      When were new hymns sung in sacramnt meeting?\n    \n    \n    \n      New Hymn\n      Opening\n      Sacrament\n      Intermediate\n      Closing\n    \n  \n  \n    Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing (1001)\n2\n0\n3\n4\n    When the Savior Comes Again (1002)\n0\n0\n0\n1\n    It Is Well with My Soul (1003)\n0\n0\n1\n1\n    His Eye Is on the Sparrow (1005)\n1\n0\n0\n1\n    As Bread is Broken (1007)\n0\n2\n0\n0\n    Bread of Life, Living Water (1008)\n0\n2\n0\n0\n    Gethsemane (1009)\n0\n1\n0\n0\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for now! I’ll try to post weekly updates over the next few hymns so we can get an idea of how they are being adopted by wards."

Typically, only about a quarter to a third of wards sing new hymns each week. A small number sing two each week. There are rare cases of three or more, but they are so infrequent, I’ve left them off this chart.\nFor each number of new hymns per week, I’ve overlaid a smooth to show the general trend. What I like about it is that is gives a shaded area showing where the proportions typically occur. Anything outside of those could be considered exceptional in some way. In this period here is one week that kinda stands out: August 4th. For some reason, that was the week where the fewest wards sang new hymns. I have no explanation for why that would be. Even when competing with holidays like Father’s Day, the martyrdom of Joseph Smith, and Pioneer Day, the number of new hymns per week stayed consistent. But a random week in early August had fewer—albeit by a small margin.\nHowever, a good chunk of my data comes from single-week contributions from various wards, so just because a ward didn’t sing a new hymn this week doesn’t mean they didn’t do any. To see what proportion of wards have introduced new hymns during this period, I took a look at the 21 wards that I have data from from at least 90% of the 15 weeks in this period. About 15% of them didn’t sing any new hymns. Otherwise, the typical number of weeks that wards have sung new hymns since June 2nd is 3–5. But, that’s only based on 21 wards and not the complete dataset, so take that number with a grain of salt."

For reference, before June 2nd, the most common hymn was I Stand All Amazed (#193) and was sung about once every 19 weeks per ward. The other hymns have been adopted with varying amounts of enthusiasm. We’ll wait until December to see how the new Christmas ones get used.\n(For a complete version of this table that includes all hymns, see here.)"

Perhaps a lot of wards are singing it a second time now.\nThere are a few other major trends so far. As Bread is Broken (#1007) was very popular on June 16th, Father’s day. A common trend was to sing Father’s Day songs for opening and closing hymns and that hymn as the sacrament hymn. Also, It Is Well With My Soul (#1003) got a little more popular July 14th and has been more popular since then. His Eye Is on the Sparrow (#1005) saw a spike on July 28th and appears to be more popular since then.

Think a Sacred Song (#1006) appears to be a little more common in the second half of the meeting, but I have only seen it sung in a few wards so that may change if more data comes in. Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing (#1001) is about as likely to be an opening hymn as a closing hymn. It Is Well with My Soul (#1003) is most common as a clsoing hymn. His Eye Is on the Sparrow (#1005) is about evently split between all three slots.

    "text": "At the back of the hymnal, there are 29 hymns that are designated as being for women or for men, either because of the text and/or because of the musical arrangement. This is a continuation from the previous hymnal, which contained many more arrangements, including choir pieces with special piano accompaniment. I don’t think these hymns are intended to be sung as congregational hymns in sacrament meeting and with a few exceptions, I don’t think they’re sung much at all. Let’s look a little closer at these arrangements."

    "section": "Types of Women’s and Men’s arrangements",
    "text": "Types of Women’s and Men’s arrangements\nWe can classify these hymns into a few different categories. First, we can group them based on the type of musical arrangement. Some of the hymns, like A Key Was Turned in Latter Days (310) or Come, All Ye Sons of God (322), look like most other hymns because they’re arranged in a normal SATB format with four voices throughout. Two of the women’s hymns, As Sisters in Zion (309) and We Meet Again As Sisters (311), look a little more like primary songs since the left hand is simplified, which makes sense because it would be somewhat strange to hear men singing either of those two. Similarly, the men’s hymn, The Priesthood of Our Lord (320) does not have full harmony lines written and appears that it is intended to be sung in unison. These two types of arrangements are both labeled “Women” or “Men” in the hymnal.\nThe other main type of musical arrangement is where it a special arrangement geared towards the voices of the gender they are for. For the women, this means it’s a SSA arrangement, with the alto on a separate staff as in Love At Home (318). The piano gets its own lines, meaning the hymn has a total of four staves, which is potentially confusing for some people at first glance. The men get TTBB arrangements, as in Oh Say, What Is Truth? (331). These are written with a tenor clef centered around C, which is essentially a treble clef but down an octave, which is intimidating at first glance and sometimes tricky to play on the piano. We could even further subdivide the men’s arrangements based on which tenor part has the melody. In most of these arrangements, the highest part has the melody, as in Come, Come Ye Saints (326). For three of them though, the highest singer gets a harmony line and the melody is below that, as in Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335). The women’s hymn The Lord is My Shepherd (316) and the men’s hymn School Thy Feelings (336) does a mix of these two, and the melody switches from one part to another. All of these special arrangements are labeled “Women’s Choir” or “Men’s Choir”.\nThe other way of classifying these 29 hymns is whether the hymn appears elsewhere in the hymnal or not. This classification is pretty closely correlated with the musical arrangement as well. For example, among the 10 women’s hymns, three are unique to women and don’t appear anywhere else in the hymnal; these three are also the ones arranged in a SATB-like format. The other seven women’s hymns are special arrangements of hymns that occur earlier in the hymnal in a SATB format.\nFor the men’s hymns, the correlation is not quite so tight. Of the six men’s hymns that are not full TTBB arrangements, four do not occur elsewhere in the hymnal. The last is Rise Up, O Men of God (324), which has a unique melody but the same lyrics as the TTBB arrangement, Rise Up, O Men of God (323), on the previous page. Of the 14 Men’s Choir arrangements, five are unique and don’t occur elsewhere in the hymnal (like See, the Mighty Angel Flying (330)), while the rest are arrangements of existing hymns, like Come, Come Ye Saints (326), including some pretty infrequently sung hymns, like Thy Servants Are Prepared (261). Then of course, Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (336) has unique lyrics, but the music is the same as Should You Feel Inclined to Censure (325).\nA summary of all these classifications can be found in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n\nTable 1: Women’s Hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nHymn Name\nArrangement type\nFound elsewhere?\nSung in Sacrament?\n\n\n\n\n309\nAs Sisters in Zion\nTwo-Part\nUnique\nyes\n\n\n310\nA Key Was Turned in Latter Days\nTwo-Part\nUnique\nno\n\n\n311\nWe Meet Again As Sisters\nTwo-Part\nUnique\nno\n\n\n312\nWe Ever Pray for Thee\nSSA\nHymn 23\nno\n\n\n313\nGod is Love\nSSA\nHymn 87\nno\n\n\n314\nHow Gentle God’s Commands\nSSA\nHymn 125\nno\n\n\n315\nJesus, the Very Thought of Thee\nSSA\nHymn 141\nno\n\n\n316\nThe Lord is My Shepherd\nSSA\nHymn 108\nno\n\n\n317\nSweet is the Work\nSSA\nHymn 147\nno\n\n\n318\nLove at Home\nSSA\nHymn 294\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Men’s Hymns.

As Sisters in Zion (309) was sung eight times, which is actually more often than almost 100 other hymns. So, still quite unusual—about once every 14 years on average—but more common than many other hymns (see Figure 1). The other women’s hymn that was sung in sacrament meeting was Love at Home (318). This though was sung just one time in all my data. I don’t know the circumstances surrounding it, but I can’t help but wonder if it was a mistake and the music coordinator intended to just do Hymn 294.Hymn 318 was actually sung in the ward next door to me, but before I moved in. I suppose I could ask!\nThere’s really not much more to say about the women’s arrangements! They’re hardly ever sung!\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Women’s and men’s arrangements"

    "text": "Men’s arrangements\nThe men’s hymns appear to have a bit more currency in sacrament meetings than the women’s hymns (see Figure 1). Seven of these 19 hymns were sung in at least one of the sacrament meetings in my sample. The most common was Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335), which was sung, on average, once every six years, or about as often as something like That Easter Morn (198). Even though it is somewhat familiar to many Latter-day Saints, it would probably be somewhat confusing for some people to sing it in sacrament meeting because it is arranged such that what appears to be the “soprano” part is actually a harmony line. Next was Ye Elders of Israel (319), which was sung 10 times in my sample. The others were only sung once or twice. Musically, the hymns Come, All Ye Sons of God (322) and Rise Up, O Men of God (324) are like Ye Elders of Israel (319) and would be less awkward to sing in church because their arrangements are perfectly fine as SATB and wouldn’t throw off the organist or the congregants. But, it would be very strange to sing See the Mighty Priesthood Gathered (325) and Go, Ye Messengers of Heaven (327) because either the melody is in the “alto” line, like Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335), or the melody is too high for a typical member to sing since it is arranged for a high tenor."

    "section": "My recommendations for the next hymnal",
    "text": "My recommendations for the next hymnal\nTo summarize, very few of the women’s and men’s arrangements are sung in sacrament meeting, and those that are are rarely done so. Based on this data, I believe these hymns should probably just be removed from the hymnal. There is little reason to print tens of thousands of these 29 hymns that hardly anyone uses. As mentioned above, the previous version of the hymnal had more arrangements—some of which were full-on choir pieces—and they were removed in this 1985 edition. It makes sense to continue that trend. We don’t need to remove them completely though—I think they should be part of an online-only supplement that would be accessible through the church’s apps and website.\nIt may be the case that these hymns were kept in the hymnal with the intention of them being sung in Relief Society and Elders Quorum meetings. But now that we do not begin those meetings with hymns anymore, there is little reason to keep them. Maybe there is value in singing one of these hymns in some stake priesthood meeting or a women’s session of General Conference, and if the hymnal is treated as “canon” for what can or cannot be sung in church meetings, then it might be worth it to keep some in there simply to hold their place as canon. In my opinion though, an online supplement can serve that purpose.\nSome of these hymns can and probably should be repurposed and brought into the main collection of hymns. For example, Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335) appears to be the most common of these 29 hymns and it would be a shame to lose it. But, there is no reason to keep it as a men’s-only arrangement: simply rearrange it as an SATB piece and I suspect it could become a more popular one."

    "text": "In addition to collecting data on how often hymns are sung in sacrament meeting, I have also gone through the rather painstaking process of quantifying all the actual music of the hymns. What I mean is that for every part (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) for every hymn, I went through and wrote down the pitch and duration of every note in a spreadsheet. With this music now reduced down to numbers, I can analyze it quantitatively. This post is the first of many that will present a numeric analysis of the music of the hymns themselves. I’ve started with the soprano line since it’s what is most familiar to most people, but I’ll eventually do similar posts on alto, tenor, and bass lines as well."

    "section": "Highest melody notes",
    "text": "Highest melody notes\nThe first question we can ask is this: what is the highest note a melody goes up to?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe highest (non-optional) melody note is an F♯5, which is found in Lean on My Ample Arm (120).\n\n\nThat of course excludes the optional G5 at the end of Carry On (255). What’s worse about the the F♯5 in Lean on My Ample Arm (120) is that it’s a sustained note—there’s nowhere to hide! However, it is very unlikely that you’ll sing it in church. In all the data I have, it was only sung four times, which means it’s sung about once every 29 years. Another way of putting it is that the hymn is sung in sacrament meeting about once a generation. So, if you can’t quite reach that F♯5, don’t worry because you will likely never need to.For what it’s worth, a combined choir from BYU sang it in General Conference in April 2008 and it was beautiful.\nWell then, what is a typical highest note for a soprano line?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe majority of hymns have D5 as their highest note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighest Note\nNumber of Hymns\nPercentage of Hymnal\n\n\n\n\nAb4\n2\n0.61%\n\n\nBb4\n1\n0.31%\n\n\nB4\n2\n0.61%\n\n\nC5\n30\n9.17%\n\n\nC#5\n6\n1.83%\n\n\nD5\n164\n50.15%\n\n\nEb5\n62\n18.96%\n\n\nE5\n54\n16.51%\n\n\nF5\n5\n1.53%\n\n\nF#5\n1\n0.31%\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are another five hymns that have melody lines that go up to an F5. But, as seen below, the only one that is moderately common is The Morning Breaks (1). The others are sung so infrequently, that their presence in sacrament meetings is negligible. Great Is the Lord (77) was sung just four times in my sample and both The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37) and Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (118) were each sung only twice. And Sweet Is the Work (317) is a women’s choir arrangement so, as I’ve discussed already, it’s not sung very much.\n\nHymns with melodies that go up to an F5\n\n\nHymn\nHow often it’s sung\n\n\n\n\nThe Morning Breaks (1)\nOnce every 3.5 years\n\n\nGreat Is the Lord (77)\nOnce every 30 years\n\n\nThe Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37)\nOnce every 60 years\n\n\nYe Simple Souls Who Stray (118)\nOnce every 60 years\n\n\nSweet Is the Work (317)\nNever?\n\n\n\nSo, six of the 341 hymns on our current hymnal go up to an F5 or F♯5, which is 1.76% of the hymnal. If all hymns were sung equally often as each other, we’d then expect that 1.76% of sacrament meeting hymns to go up to an F5 or F♯5. In reality, only 0.24% of them do, which means these six hymns are less common than expected. On average, you’ll encounter one maybe once every two and a half years. And if you do, three-quarters of the time it’ll be The Morning Breaks (1).\nI can’t help but wonder whether that high melody note is the reason these hymns are so uncommon. It may be the case that they are unusual hymns anyway that for whatever reason are not sung very often. But I think that these hymns are uncommon at least partially because of these high notes. A music coordinator might consider selecting one of these for their ward to sing in sacrament meeting, but for the sake of everyone’s voices, ultimately decides against it. Thus, the high note perpetuates the rarity of the hymn. We saw this with the key signatures as well: hymns with marginally-attested phenomena (in this case, the keys of A and Db) are rarer than they would be due to chance alone."

Collectively, these 54 hymns make up 15.84% of the hymnal. 12.21% of the hymns sung in my sample of sacrament meetings are one of these 54, so you’ll see an E5 about once every 2.5 weeks.

There are only 6 that go up to a C♯ or D♭, including Because I Have Been Given Much (219). The figure below shows all of them and how often they occur. It’s interesting that even though there are six hymns that fall into this category, two are sacrament hymns and one is a very common one. So even though they make up just 1.76% of the hymnal, they make up about 2.65% of the hymns sung in church. You’re likely to see one every 11 or so weeks on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think there are relatively few that have this particular note simply because of what key signatures are most common. It’s probably not a coincidence that one of the two hymns in D♭ are in this category. Most of the others are in A♭. If there were more hymns in D♭ major, or even A♭ we might see more hymns where the highest note is D♭5.\nAnother 30 hymns only go as high as a C5, including Choose the Right (239) and Come, Follow Me (116). They make up 8.8% of the hymnal but 11.7% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are five hymns don’t ever go higher than the middle of the treble clef. The two that only go to a B4 are both pretty well known: Secret Prayer (144) and Lead, Kindly Light (197). The only one that has B♭4 as the highest note is for men, Ye Who Are Called to Labor (321), so it might not even count as a “soprano” note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe lowest highest melody note is an A♭4, which is found in the rare God Moves in a Mysterious Way (285) and the extremely rare Now the Day is Over (159).\n\n\nThese two hymns are low enough that even a good tenor could sing the melody in the right octave! In total, there are just five hymns that don’t reach a C5, which is only 1.5% of the hymnal. And they’re rarer hymns, so they only make up 0.72% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting. So, if your highest note is a B, you might be able to sing melody once every 10 months or so. At least these lower hymns are more common that the hymns that go up to an F5 or F♯5!"

So, if I were in charge, I’d selfishly transpose many of these hymns down a bit so that their highest note is in a more comfortable range for me. But, I know many other people have no problem singing a D or even an E, so I’m not recommending that the hymnal lower any of these hymns."
