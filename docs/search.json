    "section": "",
    "text": "At the back of the hymnal, there are 29 hymns that are designated as being for women or for men, either because of the text and/or because of the musical arrangement. This is a continuation from the previous hymnal, which contained many more arrangements, including choir pieces with special piano accompaniment. I don’t think these hymns are intended to be sung as congregational hymns in sacrament meeting and with a few exceptions, I don’t think they’re sung much at all. Let’s look a little closer at these arrangements."

    "section": "Types of Women’s and Men’s arrangements",
    "text": "Types of Women’s and Men’s arrangements\nWe can classify these hymns into a few different categories. First, we can group them based on the type of musical arrangement. Some of the hymns, like A Key Was Turned in Latter Days (310) or Come, All Ye Sons of God (322), look like most other hymns because they’re arranged in a normal SATB format with four voices throughout. Two of the women’s hymns, As Sisters in Zion (309) and We Meet Again As Sisters (311), look a little more like primary songs since the left hand is simplified, which makes sense because it would be somewhat strange to hear men singing either of those two. Similarly, the men’s hymn, The Priesthood of Our Lord (320) does not have full harmony lines written and appears that it is intended to be sung in unison. These two types of arrangements are both labeled “Women” or “Men” in the hymnal.\nThe other main type of musical arrangement is where it a special arrangement geared towards the voices of the gender they are for. For the women, this means it’s a SSA arrangement, with the alto on a separate staff as in Love At Home (318). The piano gets its own lines, meaning the hymn has a total of four staves, which is potentially confusing for some people at first glance. The men get TTBB arrangements, as in Oh Say, What Is Truth? (331). These are written with a tenor clef centered around C, which is essentially a treble clef but down an octave, which is intimidating at first glance and sometimes tricky to play on the piano. We could even further subdivide the men’s arrangements based on which tenor part has the melody. In most of these arrangements, the highest part has the melody, as in Come, Come Ye Saints (326). For three of them though, the highest singer gets a harmony line and the melody is below that, as in Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335). The women’s hymn The Lord is My Shepherd (316) and the men’s hymn School Thy Feelings (336) does a mix of these two, and the melody switches from one part to another. All of these special arrangements are labeled “Women’s Choir” or “Men’s Choir”.\nThe other way of classifying these 29 hymns is whether the hymn appears elsewhere in the hymnal or not. This classification is pretty closely correlated with the musical arrangement as well. For example, among the 10 women’s hymns, three are unique to women and don’t appear anywhere else in the hymnal; these three are also the ones arranged in a SATB-like format. The other seven women’s hymns are special arrangements of hymns that occur earlier in the hymnal in a SATB format.\nFor the men’s hymns, the correlation is not quite so tight. Of the six men’s hymns that are not full TTBB arrangements, four do not occur elsewhere in the hymnal. The last is Rise Up, O Men of God (324), which has a unique melody but the same lyrics as the TTBB arrangement, Rise Up, O Men of God (323), on the previous page. Of the 14 Men’s Choir arrangements, five are unique and don’t occur elsewhere in the hymnal (like See, the Mighty Angel Flying (330)), while the rest are arrangements of existing hymns, like Come, Come Ye Saints (326), including some pretty infrequently sung hymns, like Thy Servants Are Prepared (261). Then of course, Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (336) has unique lyrics, but the music is the same as Should You Feel Inclined to Censure (325).\nA summary of all these classifications can be found in Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n\nTable 1: Women’s Hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nHymn Name\nArrangement type\nFound elsewhere?\nSung in Sacrament?\n\n\n\n\n309\nAs Sisters in Zion\nTwo-Part\nUnique\nyes\n\n\n310\nA Key Was Turned in Latter Days\nTwo-Part\nUnique\nno\n\n\n311\nWe Meet Again As Sisters\nTwo-Part\nUnique\nno\n\n\n312\nWe Ever Pray for Thee\nSSA\nHymn 23\nno\n\n\n313\nGod is Love\nSSA\nHymn 87\nno\n\n\n314\nHow Gentle God’s Commands\nSSA\nHymn 125\nno\n\n\n315\nJesus, the Very Thought of Thee\nSSA\nHymn 141\nno\n\n\n316\nThe Lord is My Shepherd\nSSA\nHymn 108\nno\n\n\n317\nSweet is the Work\nSSA\nHymn 147\nno\n\n\n318\nLove at Home\nSSA\nHymn 294\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Men’s Hymns.

So, still quite unusual—about once every 14 years on average—but more common than many other hymns (see Figure 1). The other women’s hymn that was sung in sacrament meeting was Love at Home (318). This though was sung just one time in all my data. I don’t know the circumstances surrounding it, but I can’t help but wonder if it was a mistake and the music coordinator intended to just do Hymn 294.Hymn 318 was actually sung in the ward next door to me, but before I moved in.

The most common was Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335), which was sung, on average, once every six years, or about as often as something like That Easter Morn (198). Even though it is somewhat familiar to many Latter-day Saints, it would probably be somewhat confusing for some people to sing it in sacrament meeting because it is arranged such that what appears to be the “soprano” part is actually a harmony line. Next was Ye Elders of Israel (319), which was sung 10 times in my sample. The others were only sung once or twice. Musically, the hymns Come, All Ye Sons of God (322) and Rise Up, O Men of God (324) are like Ye Elders of Israel (319) and would be less awkward to sing in church because their arrangements are perfectly fine as SATB and wouldn’t throw off the organist or the congregants. But, it would be very strange to sing See the Mighty Priesthood Gathered (325) and Go, Ye Messengers of Heaven (327) because either the melody is in the “alto” line, like Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335), or the melody is too high for a typical member to sing since it is arranged for a high tenor."

    "section": "My recommendations for the next hymnal",
    "text": "My recommendations for the next hymnal\nTo summarize, very few of the women’s and men’s arrangements are sung in sacrament meeting, and those that are are rarely done so. Based on this data, I believe these hymns should probably just be removed from the hymnal. There is little reason to print tens of thousands of these 29 hymns that hardly anyone uses. As mentioned above, the previous version of the hymnal had more arrangements—some of which were full-on choir pieces—and they were removed in this 1985 edition. It makes sense to continue that trend. We don’t need to remove them completely though—I think they should be part of an online-only supplement that would be accessible through the church’s apps and website.\nIt may be the case that these hymns were kept in the hymnal with the intention of them being sung in Relief Society and Elders Quorum meetings. But now that we do not begin those meetings with hymns anymore, there is little reason to keep them. Maybe there is value in singing one of these hymns in some stake priesthood meeting or a women’s session of General Conference, and if the hymnal is treated as “canon” for what can or cannot be sung in church meetings, then it might be worth it to keep some in there simply to hold their place as canon. In my opinion though, an online supplement can serve that purpose.\nSome of these hymns can and probably should be repurposed and brought into the main collection of hymns. For example, Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335) appears to be the most common of these 29 hymns and it would be a shame to lose it. But, there is no reason to keep it as a men’s-only arrangement: simply rearrange it as an SATB piece and I suspect it could become a more popular one."

    "section": "Lowest melody notes",
    "text": "Lowest melody notes\nWhen we think of sopranos, we often think of high notes. We’ve already seen that while the soprano line can go as high as an F♯5 in Lead on My Ample Arm (#120), it typically goes up to a D5. But, sopranos do have to sing low sometimes too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe lowest melody note is an A♭3, which is found in The Star-Spangled Banner (340) and Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (118).\n\n\nIt is worth noting that that A♭3 in both songs is in a unison passage. In the The Star-Spangled Banner (340) all four parts are in unison and the soprano has to hit that note four times. That melody is notorious for being difficult for a normal person to sing because of its octave and a half range, so presumably they didn’t want to raise the key too much otherwise it would end up going very high. Its a lose-lose I guess.\n\n\n\nThe Star-Spangled Banner (#340)\n\n\nFor Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (118), the soprano and altos are in unison for the entire first half of the hymn. If you look at the same hymn in the 1948 hymnal (#290), you’ll see first off that it’s a “Choir” arrangement—yes, they had full-on choir arrangements in the back of the hymnal—so it’s probably a little more difficult to sing and maybe not intended for congregational singing. Furthermore, that lower melody line in the first half of the hymn is only written for the altos to sing. There may be a remnant of that in the 1985 hymnal because, if you compare the phrases where sopranos and altos are in unison in Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (#118) to The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37), you’ll see that in the latter, we have stems in the notes going in both directions, suggesting soprano and alto in unison. However, in the former, you only see one stem. Perhaps then, the intention is for altos to sing that first half of the hymn and for the sopranos to come in later.Please note the copy that I have is the 11th printing, dated 1957. It has a red cover. I don’t know enough about the various printings of that hymnal to know what differences there are between them.\n\n\n\nYe Simple Souls Who Stray (#118)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37)\n\n\nRegardless, this low A♭3 is, for both hymns, pretty exceptional.\nHow often will a congregation see one of these two hymns? Well, spoiling a bit of a future 4th of July post, I’ll go ahead and say that it looks like only about a third of the wards in the US sing The Star-Spangled Banner (340) every year. To put it another way, one ward might sing it once every three years, on average. Meanwhile, Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (118) is one of the rarest hymns in the hymnal and is basically a once- or twice-in-a-lifetime kind of hymn. So, sopranos, don’t sweat it if you can’t quite hit that A♭3."

Zion Stands with Hills Surrounded (#43) just pops down there one time, unison with the altos, and never really comes close to it again. It is also extremely rare, being sung about once a generation or so.\n\n\n\nZion Stands with Hills Surrounded (#43)\n\n\n\n\nB♭3\nFourteen hymns have the sopranos going down to a Bb3. In all cases, the soprano line is in unison with the alto line, meaning there is no lower alto note being sung at that time. In some hymns, all four parts are unison when that B♭3 is being sung. We get that in Awake and Arise (#8), For the Strength of the Hills (#35), Hail to the Brightness of Zion’s Glad Morning! (#42), ’Tis Sweet to Sing the Matchless Love (#177), and Ye Elders of Israel (#319). In the case of Because I Have Been Given Much (#219), there is technically no alto part since it is marked as unison, but there is a G3 below it that could very well be an alto line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwake and Arise (#8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Strength of the Hills (#35)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHail to the Brightness of Zion’s Glad Morning!

For some hymns, it’s the first note of the song, it’s usually the dominant, and it never goes that low again. We see that in Awake and Arise (#8), For the Strength of the Hills (#35), Hail to the Brightness of Zion’s Glad Morning! (#42), As Now We Take the Sacrament (#169), and As Zion’s Youth in Latter Days (#256). In Joseph Smith’s First Prayer (#26) and Silent Night (#204), it’s in the key of Bb and the last note of the hymn is the lowest one. The rest have the low note somewhere else in the middle, but usually only one time. The hymn Ye Elders of Israel (#319) has that low note integrated throughout, including the beginning, a few times in the middle, and also near the end. Of course, it’s intended for men to sing, so we might not be right in calling it a “soprano” line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Smith’s First Prayer (#26)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilent Night (#204)\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, given that some of these hymns are fairly common, it is not unusual to see this B♭3. We have two sacrament hymns, a popular Christmas hymn, and three other very popular hymns. The other seven are not very common. But, collectively, these 14 hymns make up 5.2% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting. That means you’re likely to encounter one about once every 5.5 weeks on average. So, unless someone happens to know that The Star-Spangled Banner (340) goes down to an A♭3 and be familiar with two very infrequent hymns, I’m guessing a typical church-goer may think that a Bb3 is the lowest soprano note.Y’know, in case typical church-goers think about these things!\n\n\nB3\nOnly 11 hymns have B3 as the lowest note in the melody. It is here that we finally get alto notes below the melody’s lowest note. For example, in There Is Sunshine in My Soul Today (#227), as the melody goes down to a B3 in the chorus, the alto is below that on a G3. We also see that same thing in There Is Sunshine in My Soul Today (#227) and Up, Awake, Ye Defenders of Zion (#248). And in Onward, Christian Soldiers (#246), the altos are holding an A3. In all other cases, the alto note is unison with the melody still.\n\n\n\nThere Is Sunshine in My Soul Today (#227)\n\n\nIt is interesting to note though that as far as where in the melody that lowest note comes is quite different from where we saw the B♭3s in the previous section. Just one hymn, How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True? (#126), has the B3 as the first note. In all other cases, the lowest note comes in the middle of a phrase, usually near the middle of the hymn. I suspect this has to do with the key signatures that are most common in the hymnal. Since we have no hymns in B major, we don’t see B3 as the dominant, and since we have no hymns in E major, we don’t see it as the subdominant, with the exception of How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True? (#126). Instead, we’re seeing it as random notes of the melody. We get it as the mediant in hymns in G major (Testimony (#137), Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd (#221), There Is Sunshine in My Soul Today (#227), and Know This, That Every Soul Is Free (#240)), the submediant for hymns in D major (Where Can I Turn for Peace? (#129) and Onward, Christian Soldiers (#246)), a leading tone for Be Thou Humble (#130) and Called to Serve (#249), which are in C major, and as an accidental in The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37) and Up, Awake, Ye Defenders of Zion (#248).Incidentally, Hymn #126 is one of only five hymns in a minor key.I 100% had to look these terms up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Long, O Lord Most Holy and True? (#126)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimony (#137)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear to the Heart of the Shepherd (#221)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere Is Sunshine in My Soul Today (#227)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere Can I Turn for Peace?

Well, none of these 11 are sacrament hymns, so it’s not going to be as likely as B♭3. But, there are some well-known ones. Collectively, these hymns make up 3.16% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting, meaning you’re likely to see one about once every 9.4 weeks or so.\n\n\nSummary of low melodies\nSo, if we summarize these exceptionally low soprano lines, there are only 28 hymns (8.2% of the hymnal) that dip below a C4. If you have quite a high voice (or perhaps are looking for a hymn that a child could sing) and can’t sing below a C4, you’ll be able to sing the soprano line about 91% of the time."

This figure shows the distribution of lowest notes for the soprano lines in the hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe typical lowest note for a melody is D4.\n\n\nThis figure shows that the majority of hymns have their lowest note at a D4. There are 147 hymns like this, which is 43.1% of the hymnal. It is interesting that this parallels the highest notes in melodies, where D5 was the most common high note. In second place is C4, with 89 hymns or 26.1% of the hymnal.\nSimilar to the highest notes, relatively few hymns have C♯3 as the lowest note, again, likely due to the distribution of key signatures in the hymnal. It does include two sacrament hymns, O God, the Eternal Father (#175) and In Memory of the Crucified and a few other relatively common hymns. On average, you’ll see that C♯4 or D♭4 about once every 5.76 weeks."

    "text": "Lowest notes that aren’t all that low\nLet’s continue to work our way up to see what hymns have relatively high notes as their lowest notes.\n\nE♭4\nThere are 26 hymns that have E♭4 as their lowest note, including five sacrament hymns. Almost all of these 26 hymns are in the key of E♭ major and almost all of those have E♭4 as their highest notes. The exceptions are We Have Partaken of Thy Love (#155) and Now the Day Is Over (#159), which are in the key of A♭ major making the lowest note the dominant instead of the tonic, and all three of the women’s choir arrangements that are on this list: God Is Love (#313), Sweet Is the Work (#317), Love at Home (#318).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE4\nJust 13 hymns have E4 as their lowest note. Many of these are in the key of C major, but otherwise there’s nothing noteworthy to say about these hymns other than the most common of them is the only one sung on average once every two years. So, you’ll encounter one of these hymns maybe once every 14 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF4\nOnly nine hymns have F4 as their lowest notes. We’ll see in a later blog post that when the melody never goes too low, it makes the whole hymn “feel” high, even if none of the notes are especially high. Come, Ye Children of the Lord (58) and What Was Witnessed in the Heavens? (11) are the hymns with the highest “average” note, and not dipping below F4 certainly contributes to that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF♯4\nFinally we get to the confusingly worded “highest lowest notes” in the hymnal. Here, lowest notes refers to the lowest notes of the melody within each song out of all the other notes in that song. But if we take all those lowest notes and put them in order from low to high, one of them is going to be the highest. So, highest here refers to the highest across all the lowest notes. Thus, we have the highest lowest notes in the soprano line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nTwo hymns have soprano lines that go no lower than an F♯4: Awake, Ye Saints of God, Awake! (#17) and Raise Your Voices to the Lord (#61).\n\n\nIf you haven’t heard of either of these hymns, it’s probably because they’re not very common. Awake, Ye Saints of God, Awake! (#17) is sung about once every 8.6 years, typically as an opening hymn. However, though the soprano line indeed never dips below an F♯4, the melody goes lower. For one portion the sopranos have rests while the altos carry the melody. In the 1948 version of the hymnal, it was #229 and was a “Choir” arrangement, more or less unchanged except in the key of D major. So, this hymn only makes it to the top of this list because of a technicality, and my guess is a typical ward member people will sing that alto line anyway.\n\n\n\nAwake, Ye Saints of God, Awake! (#17)\n\n\nThe other hymn, Raise Your Voices to the Lord (#61), has an F♯4 as its lowest note fair and square. In fact, I wonder if setting this hymn in a relatively high key may have been intentional: it is called “Raise Your Voices” after all. In fact, when comparing the current arrangement to the one in the 1948 hymnal, I think there are cases where they deliberately made the parts higher. The bass line currently has C3 as its lowest note instead of the G2 in the previous version and the tenor line is pretty consistently above the bass clef. (The alto line is in about the same range and is is only different because the chords have changed a little bit.) So while none of the parts have extremely high notes, they are often in the upper parts of their ranges. If this was on purpose, that is some nice word painting. It’s too bad hardly anyone gets to enjoy that though because this short hymn is sung about once every 10.6 years, typically as a closing hymn.\n\n\n\nRaise Your Voices to the Lord (#61)"

    "text": "The most common hymns\nThe most common hymns sung in the church, according to my data, are displayed in the figure below. Here, sacrament hymns are in gray and other hymns are in black. I’ve shown only the hymns that are sung, on average, one or more times per year per ward. Since I’ve already posted about the sacrament hymns, I’ll focus now on just the non-sacrament hymns.You may think that a lot of hymns that pertain to specific holidays would make it onto this list, but as we’ll see in later blog posts about annual trends, there are actually relatively few festive hymns that are sung by most wards most years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows nice list of 24 hymns that are probably well-known by most members of the church, like I Know That My Redeemer Lives (#136), How Firm a Foundation (#85), and Because I Have Been Given Much (#219). They are generic enough to be appropriate for most meetings. Their message is centered on Christ and other foundation tenents of our religion. Some are more common around certain holidays, like Come, Come Ye Saints (#30) around Pioneer Day in Utah or Love At Home (#294) around Mother’s Day, but they’re also general enough to be appropriate at other times of the year as well. Thus, what we see in the figure above is a solid list of the most popular hymns in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nThis figure also shows how common each of these hymns are. Because I Have Been Given Much (219) is sung about 1.6 times per year, or once every 7.5 months. How Firm a Foundation (#85) and were about once every 7–8 months. I Know That My Redeemer Lives (#136) was sung, on average, 1.5 times per year per ward, or about once every six or so months. Lord, I Would Follow Thee (#220) and We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (#19) were once every 8–9 months. I Believe in Christ (134), Now Let Us Rejoice (3), and High on the Mountain Top (5), The Lord Is My Light (#89), and Come, Follow Me (#116) were once every 8–9 months. The rest were less than once every 10 months but still at least once a year. Of course, your ward may sing these more or less often than what is shown here, but this is the average across all the wards I have data from.\nTo contrast this, about nine sacrament hymns are sung, on average, more than twice a year. Keep in mind that there are only 48 sacrament meetings per year, and 28 sacrament hymns to choose from, so many will have to double up. None of the non-sacrament hymns were sung, on average, more than twice a year.\nThis list of favorites is useful because if you are a new ward organist, these are the hymns to practice first. Learning these 24 hymns (plus the sacrament hymns) will get you the most mileage. In fact, these 49 hymns account for 44.3% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting in this sample. That means that if you learn the hymns shown in the figure above, you’ll be able to play almost half of the meetings in your ward.\n\nAre these the “standards”?\nIt is interesting to compare this list of the most popular hymns, which I’m calling the “favorites,” to the list in the back of the hymnal under the section “Hymns for Stake Conference” (page 381). That section lists “standard, well-known hymns” and it is implied that many members would have these hymns memorized. Interestingly, there is not a lot of overlap between these lists. The following figure shows which hymns appear in the figure above and are usually sung more than once a year (excluding sacrament hymns), and which are the “standards” listed in the back of the hymnal. This time, the hymns in purple are ones that are recommended as “standards” and are indeed sung pretty regularly. The blue ones are what are sung pretty often but are not one of “the standards” listed in the back of the hymnal. The red ones are recommended “standards” that are not as popular. Most of lesser-popular “standards” are still sung pretty regularly, usually at least once every two years. The exception is Come, O Thou King of Kings (#59), which is sung less than once every two years and is not what I would consider to be a popular hymn.\nHowever, it should be kept in mind that this isn’t exactly a fair comparison. For one, this list of “standards” is what is recommended for stake conference, which is not the same as sacrament meeting. Also, this list printed in the back of the hymnal is presumably what was recommended in 1985 when this hymnal was first published. What is considered a standard has surely changed in the past few decades. Furthermore, many of the currently most popular hymns were new additions to the 1985 hymnal, including Because I Have Been Given Much (#219), I Believe in Christ (#134), I Am a Child of God (#301), and Called to Serve (#249). It makes sense that they’re not recommended in the back of the hymnal because they were brand new when that list was published! How could they have know they’d be so popular? My recommendation for the church would be to update the list of stake conference recommendations to include these most popular hymns and to remove the ones that are less common today."

    "section": "A brief note about my calculations",
    "text": "A brief note about my calculations\nLet me first mention my methods for how I’m calculating how often a hymn is sung, on average, per ward. I currently have data from 18,369 sacrament meetings. A ward will meet together for sacrament meeting usually 48 times in a year (52 weeks minus two for General Conference and minus two for Stake Conference). 18,369 meetings divided by 48 meetings in a year is about 382 years’ worth of sacrament meetings—far more than any one person could attend in their lifetime. So, if there’s a hymn that’s sung in just one of those sacrament meetings, that means it’s sung, on average per ward, once every 382 years. If a hymn is sung 100 times in my dataset, it’s sung on average once every 18369 / 48 / 100 = 3.82 years per ward.\nBecause I’m dealing with very sparse numbers in this post, the numbers may fluctuate wildly. As I collect more data, the exact numbers jump around quite a bit when we get to the very infrequent hymns. For example, if a hymn is sung three times in my dataset, that comes out to once every 127 years. If it’s sung just twice, it’s once every 191 years. That’s a big jump for a single data point. So, you should take these numbers with a grain of salt they mostly reflect how much data I have. Instead, I’ll group them into broad categories of “once a decade,” “once a generation,” and “once in a lifetime.”\nPlease note that I have removed the men’s and women’s arrangements (hymns 309–337) from these lists because, as I’ve already written, they’re probably not really intended or appropriate for sacrament meeting.\nSo, with that in mind, let’s most on to the least common hymns."

I like to think of The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37) as being “famous for not being famous,” particularly among LDS musicians, and with its high melody and tenor lines, unusual chords, and potentially offensive lyrics, it’s no surprise that it’s not sung very often. Some of these hymns are ones that the Tabernacle Choir sings but that I otherwise don’t recognize. Most of the hymns in the first half the hymnal, I hardly recognize at all. Meanwhile, the ones in the second half of the hymnal are ones that I recognize only because they’re interspersed among some of the more common, upbeat hymns in the 200-range. Overall, there is nothing too surprising here: there aren’t any hymns that I feel like are more popular than they really are."

Another way of thinking about these is that in the lifetime of a physical copy of a hymnal, there is a decent chance that most of these nine hymns were never sung.\nI recognize two of these hymns because they stand out in interesting ways. First, is Lean on My Ample Arm (120) which is my favorite hymn. There’s also Softly Now the Light of Day (160) which, at only two lines and one verse, is tied with the once-every-six-years Praise God, from Whom All Blessings Flow (242) for the shortest hymn in the hymnal..If you want to get really technical, Hymn 242 is shorter because its suggested tempo marking includes slower tempos.\nOthers in this list can be explained a little bit.\n\nHere we get the other hymn in D♭, Softly Beams the Sacred Dawning (56).\nWe Meet Again in Sabbath School (282) makes sense for being on this list because it’s likely intended to be an opening hymn for Sunday School, and not sacrament meeting. Although, we don’t start Sunday School with hymns anymore, so it’s likely not getting any currency anymore.\nThe hymn Come, Let Us Sing an Evening Hymn (167) makes sense since most wards meet in the morning.\nIt’s also not surprising that God Save the King (341) is hardly sung in my sample, partially because I don’t have a lot of data from the UK and the reigning monarch the entire time was a queen rather than a king.\nFinally, it seems like This House We Dedicate to Thee (#245) is intended for a building dedication which probably not very many people actually get to attend in their lifetimes. It’s a perfectly good hymn and very appropriate for the occasion—but regular sacrament meeting is not such an occasion.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, we actually sang God Save the King (#341) in Priesthood Opening Exercises, back when they had those. We did it becauase one of the young women from the ward was sitting in because she needed to make an announcement, so the Bishop asked her to give the prayer, because, how often do you see a young woman give the opening prayer in a Priesthood meeting? So, while we’re seeing things we’ve never seen before, we sang God Save the King (#341).It is interesting to note that, with a large enough sample and if you ignore the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back, I was able to find evidence of every hymn being sung at least once in some meeting somewhere."

    "text": "Overall Frequency\nTo me, it is wild to think that these 17 hymns (plus many of the men’s and women’s arrangements) have been printed in tens of thousands of hymnals for the past nearly 40 years and have hardly ever been used by anyone. On the plus side, these lists are somewhat small, especially the list of hymns never sung at all. It appears to be the case then that pretty much every hymn is sung at least a little bit. So, inflated claims along the lines of “there are 100 hymns that literally no one sings” simply aren’t accurate. They’re not common, but they are sung.\nIn fact, if we take all 67 hymns that I’ve listed on this page, and count up how many times they were sung, it comes out to 1,180 times in this sample, which is 1.85% of all the data. That means you might sing one of these 67 hymns once every four months, or about as often as I Stand All Amazed (193). Another way of thinking about it is that we could cut these 67 hymns, and it would affect about one meeting every four months.\nPerhaps a better way of looking at this is to think about how many wards sing a given hymn around the world. There are around 31,330 wards and branches across the world. Let’s say that the 18,369 meetings I have data are a representative sample with one ward contributing data all in the same week. That would be 58.6% of the congregations around the whole world. If one of them sings something like Sons of Michael, He Approaches (#51), we might therefore assume that perhaps maybe one other congregation around the world will sing that hymn in a given week. For comparison, if we apply the same logic, I Stand All Amazed (#193) would be sung in 1,755 different congregations every week.See more facts and figures published by the church here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should take that claim about how many wards around the world sing these hymns with a monster grain of salt for at least the following reasons:\n\nThe wards I have data from are not representative of units across the world. Roughly 85% of my data comes from the US, for example, while less than half the congregations in the world come from the US.\nWe can’t assume the 18,369 meetings are independent of each other because most wards contributed data from more than one sacrament meeting. So we can’t interpret them as coming from 18,369 independent wards in the same week.\nAs we’ll see in later posts, holidays matter, and the likelihood of singing any one hymn goes up and down depending on things like holidays, Fast Sundays, and proximity to General Conference. So the odds of singing these unusual hymns is basically zero the week before Christmas, but slightly higher in a random week in September or something.\nAlso, the type of music coordinators that keep spreadsheets are likely the ones who try to diversify the hymns they sing. There are likely many wards who do not have spreadsheets and may sing from a more limited selection throughout the year.\n\nI wanted to point out these caveats, but it’s still interesting to think about how many times these hymns are sung around the world on a given Sunday."

    "text": "Concluding thoughts\nIn this blog post, I took a closer look at hymns that are sung at most once a decade. Many of them were sung less often that that, if they were sung at all.\nBut should we cut these hymns? Unless there are issues with the text, message, or doctrine, I don’t see any reason why we should remove hymns per se. In fact, some hymns, like We Meet Again in Sabbath School (#282) or This House We Dedicate to Thee (#245) are/were quite appropriate in very specific, albeit infrequent, circumstances. So, should they be printed in tens of thousands of hymnals? In my opinion, probably not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for the next hymnal\n\n\n\nPut these special hymns into an online supplement to the hymnal, like what I recommend for the men’s and women’s arrangements. Make it clear that these are approved for use in the church and part of the “canon” but are simply not printed for practical reasons.\nAs for the special hymns that are useful for certain occasions, set them aside in a section called “special occasions” or something that would catch people’s attention. We don’t want them to be overlooked when those special occasions do arise. It would be a shame to lose these hymns simply because the occasions they are written for don’t happen very often.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation to music coordinators\n\n\n\nIt is unlikely that many people in your ward will be familiar with more than a few hymns listed on this page. If you want to be adventurous and try a really uncommon hymm, these are the ones to choose from. But, it might be good to help the ward out a little bit by having the ward choir sing it first, having the organist play it for prelude a few weeks prior, having the organist play the entire hymn as an introduction, and having the organist use play the melody on the swell (or use a melody coupler) with a reed stop pulled to make it easier to hear.\nRegardless of whether you use these hymns, you should get familiar with these techniques for introducing hymns to ward members because we’ll all likely need to start using them when we get the new hymnal anyway.\n\n\nFunny story. Someone contributed a couple years’ worth of data from their ward and I mentioned that they sang three of the most unusual hymns in the span of two weeks. The sister wrote back saying the music coordinator was released right after that and she was called with a special request from her bishop to sing songs people were familiar with. So, if you go too overboard, it might cost you your calling!If you have sung one of these 67 hymns recently in your ward, that’s pretty cool because few people can sasy they have!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "There are two hymns that stand out as “General Conference hymns”. The first is We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19), which is 3.50 times more likely to be sung within a week of General Conference than all the other weeks of the year combined. The second is Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) and is 2.81 times as likely to be sung within a week of General Conference than any other week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe two most typical General Conference hymns are We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) and Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21).\n\n\nHowever, to be clear, while the hymns are somewhat common, not all wards sing them around General Conference. Generally, We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) is sung about every 37.5 weeks in a ward. But, only 28.7% of wards sing it within a week of General Conference. To put it another way, a ward might do so once every seven General Conferences. The other, Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21), is less common generally and is sung once every 1.74 years, or rather, only 57% of wards will sing it in a given year. Within a week of General Conference, only 17.4% of wards will sing it, or a single ward might do it once every 5.5–6 years. So, singing General Conference hymns is not a terribly common thing.\nWe can take a closer look at the annual trends of these two General Conference hymns. General Conference takes place on the first Sunday of April and October. So, I’ve taken the dates of all the times those two hymns are sung and counted how many weeks they are until or since the nearest General Conference. I then tallied all the data, by hymn and by Conference (April vs. October), and produced the plot shown in Figure 1. General Conference itself is indicated by the dotted blue line. The shaded region is around the time that is seven days or less from General Conference.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Annual trends of General Conference hymns.\n\n\nHere we can see that these two hymns are literally centered around General Conference. In general, We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) (top panels) is the more common hymn. Around the April General Conference, it’s most common the week before, and two weeks after. In the October General Conference, it’s more common he two weeks before and one week after. Since it’s a popular hymn and a stable in LDS hymnody, it’s sung throughout the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief soapbox/rant\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t think We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) should be thought of as a hymn about prophets. Yes, the first two lines are about prophets who guide us in these latter-days. But look at the rest of the lyrics. We thank Thee for the gospel and every blessing and we want to serve Thee. The second verse is about how the Lord will deliver us. The third verse is a bit of a grabbag of topics, but prophets are not mentioned. This is not a hymn about prophets; it’s a prayer of gratitude and praise.\nHowever, it has become the prophets hymn. I mean, look how often it’s sung in General Conference! I think the reason for this is because the first line happens to mention prophets. Although, again, it’s within the context of a prayer of gratitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for the next hymnal\n\n\n\nWe should give this a new title and/or a new first verse. I think it’s appropriately placed in the “restoration” section of the hymnal, but I think it should be moved further from “prophets” subsection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for music coordinators\n\n\n\nConsider singing this hymn around Thanksgiving to highlight its message as a prayer of gratitude.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) (bottom panels) is less common overall. Around the April General Conference, there’s a slight increase in how often it’s sung, but not as clear of a spike. And I’m not really sure why there is a secondary spike four weeks after. There is a clearer spike after the October General Conference, and is most common two weeks before and one week after.\nIn general, the April spikes are smaller than the October spikes. This is most likely because General Conference competes with Easter in April, so wards are more likely to sing Easter hymns instead. So, around the October General Conference is when you’re most likely to hear these hymns.\nI can glean two interesting things from Figure 1. First, the General Conference “season” appears to start two weeks before and ends two weeks after the conference itself. I could imagine wards assigning speakers topics related to general conference (prophets, revelation, etc) leading up to it, and “what did you learn” or “what was your favorite talk” topics afterwards. Anything beyond that though, and there’s no evidence, at least in the hymns we sing, that General Conference is the focus of sacrament meeting.\nThe second interesting thing I see in Figure 1 is something we’ll see with other holidays too: music coordinators choose the less popular hymns further from the holiday itself and the more popular ones closer to the holiday. Looking at October, we see that the largest spike in the entire figure is for We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) the week before conference. Meanwhile, Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) actually has a drop during that same week. It seems like music coordinators don’t want to “waste” a “good” hymn on a less-than-ideal week.\n\n\nNow that we’ve established which hymns are sung and how often they are, let’s zoom into the sacrament meetings themselves. Figure 2 shows that these two hymns are both the most common as opening hymns. Interestingly, We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) is also pretty common as a closing hymn, but Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21) is not. I’m not sure why there’s a difference in when these two hymns are sung during sacrament, but it would be intriguing to figure out why.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: When during sacrament meeting are General Conference hymns sung?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStats for nerds :)\n\n\n\n\n\nA \\(\\chi^2\\) test suggests that the different patterns between these two is actually not statistically significant: \\(\\chi^2\\) = 3.712, df = 2, p = 0.156.\n\n\n\nSplitting this plot up by weeks leading up to and following General Conference, we see that the clearest trend overall is to sing We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) as the opening hymn the week before General Conference. Besides that, it’s hard to point out any clear patterns, probably because we’ve stretched the data too thinly. (You can submit your ward’s data here!)\n\n\n\nFigure 3: An even deeper look into when these hymns are sung in sacrament meeting by week\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than two prophet-related hymns in our hymnal, but it turns out that very few of them can be considered “General Conference hymns.” Not only are they rare generally, but also there’s no noticeable increase in frequency around General Conference. Figure 4 shows a plot of all the hymns listed in the Topics index under the heading “Prophets,” in order of how common they are generally.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Annual trends of other prophet-related hymns.\n\n\nAs you can see, there are no appreciable spikes around conference season. The most common, Praise to the Man (27) is most common earlier in the Spring, presumably around the time of the First Vision. In people’s defense, Praise to the Man (27) is about a particular prophet, and doesn’t seem like the most appropriate hymn for General Conference. Come, Sing to the Lord (10) is more about the Restoration. Most of the other hymns are just not very common any time of the year.\nThe surprise for me is how uncommon other hymns that are very clearly prophet-related, that would be no less appropriate than the two more common ones, and that are right near the other two hymns in the hymnal are. We Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (22) is only sung once every 4.79 years per ward, or rather only 20.9% of wards sing it in a given year. There is a slight increase in frequency around General Conference, but, going back to saving the “good” ones for the prime slot, it’s most common two weeks before the October conference and one week after. We Ever Pray for Thee (24) is once every 6.76 years per ward, or in only 14.8% of wards. And God Bless Our Prophet Dear (25) is once every 7.66 years per ward, or in only 13.1% of wards. Both of these have very small spikes around General Conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation to music coordinators\n\n\n\nUse these prophet-related hymns more, especially if your ward has General Conference–related sacrament meetings around then. We have enough of them to sprinkle throughout the two weeks before and after conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though we have several prophet-related hymns, the two most common are We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19) and Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21). While they’re sung throughout the year, they’re most common within two weeks of General Conference, especially as opening hymns. April conferences are less likely to see prophet-related hymns than October conferences because of competition with Easter. Some other prophet-related hymns are very occasionally sung around the General Conference “season.”"

    "text": "The most common sacrament hymn is “I Stand All Amazed” (193). In this plot, you can see that it’s sung on average, about once every four and a half months per year per ward. 1/n INSERT IMAGE\nOther common sacrament hymns are “In Humility, Our Savior” (172), “There is a Green Hill Far Away” (194), and “Jesus, Once of Humble Birth” (196). Each of these is sung around 2–3 times per year, on average, or once every four to five months. 2/n\nMost sacrament hymns are sung at least once a year per ward, on average, but there were some that were less common. “O Lord of Hosts (178)”, “Again, Our Dear Redeeming Lord (179)”, and “Again, We Meet around the Board (186)” each averaged once every 13–17 months. 3/n\nKeep in mind that some wards systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns. Including these wards evens out the numbers a little bit. When I excluded them, the common hymns were slightly more frequent and the uncommon ones were even rarer. 4/n INSERT IMAGE\nThe least frequent sacrament hymn is “O Thou, Before the World Began” (189). It’s sung, on average, about once every two years. But if your ward doesn’t systematically cycle through the hymns though, it’s sung only about once every three years. 5/n\nIn the “Sacrament” section of the topic index, it lists two additional hymns: “O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown” (197) and “Gently Raise the Sacred Strain” (146). The first one is more Eastery and the second is more “Prayer and Supplication”-y, so that makes sense. 6/n\n“O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown” (197) was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every four years. “Gently Raise the Sacred Strain” (146) was about once every two years, which is more than some “official” sacrament hymns! 7/n INSERT IMAGE\nVery occasionally, a ward will sing a sacrament hymn as the opening, closing, or intermediate hymn. This is most common with “I Stand All Amazed” (193). Across all 28 hymns, it happens about 1.1% of the time, or once every 22 months in a given ward, on average. 8/n\nIn conclusion, it appears that we stick pretty close to the “rules” about that second hymn in sacrament meeting. Some wards cycle through while others pick and choose. Some are favorites and some are less common and two are “honorary” members of the group. 9/9\nYou can read more about these findings at https://hymnstats.joeystanley.com/findings.html#sacrament-hymns.

In fact, the top 15 most common hymns are sacrament hymns. If we disregard those, the most common hymn is “I Know that My Redeemer Lives (136).” 1/n INSERT FIGURE\nThe top three most popular hymns are “I Know That My Redeemer Lives (136),” “How Firm a Foundation (85),” and “Because I Have Been Given Much (219).” Each of these are sung, on average, at least 1.5 times per year per ward. That seems low, but that’s what the data show. 2/n\nOther popular hymns include “Lord, I Would Follow Thee (220),” and “I Believe in Christ (134),” “High on the Mountain Top (5),” “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19),” and “Now Let Us Rejoice (3),” which are each sung every 9.5 months or so, on average, per ward. 3/n\nAnother 14 hymns are sung, on average, more than once per year per ward, not including sacrament hymns. 4/n\nInterestingly, the back of the hymnbook has a list of “standard” hymns that presumably everyone knows that would be good for stake conference. Only about half of those “standard” hymns are actually sung more than once a year. 5/n INSERT IMAGE\nThe fact that the standard hymns aren’t the same as the popular ones means that what we consider our favorites has shifted in the past 38 years since the hymnal came out.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was talking to someone about this project, and they said something like, “Our ward does a good job at singing unusual hymns. We probably get through the entire hymnal every year.” I can tell you now that’s impossible. Let’s explore that a little bit.\nThere are 52 weeks in a year. Subtract two for General Conference and subtract two for Stake Conference. You’re left with 48 sacrament meetings per year. If you sang an opening, sacrament, intermediate, and closing hymn in all 48 of those meetings, that’s 196 hymns. But, subtract 12 for Fast Sundays, which have no intermediate hymn. So, you’re left with a maximum of 184 congregational hymns per year per ward. That’s assuming zero special musical numbers ever.Okay, some years have 53 Sundays, but for simplicity, we’ll keep it at 52For what it’s worth, I assume 48 sacrament meetings per year for everything in this project.\nWell, right off the bat, we know that you can’t possibly get through the entire hymnal in a year, because there are 341 hymns! Even if you exclude the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back, which are hardly ever sung, and (for American wards) God Save the King (#341), that’s 310 hymns.\nBut, let’s not forget that sacrament hymns almost always have to be one of the hymns in the 169–196 range. There are 28 of them. We’ll assume you get through all 28 of them, but not all wards do because there are a few that are clearly less popular than others. So, 48 of your 184 hymns are tied up as sacrament hymns, some of which will have to be repeated. That leaves 136 remaining opening, intermediate, and closing hymn slots. If you didn’t repeat any and had zero special musical numbers, then yes, you could sing 136 unique hymns, plus the 28 sacrament hymns, for a total of 164 unique hymns per year. That is the maximum any ward could do.\nIf you really were determined to all 310 hymns without repeating, except for sacrament hymns, it would take 94 weeks to do so, or just shy of two years, under perfect conditions. But having special musical numbers and ward choirs makes it impossible to reach that goal. (And I’d encourage you to not deny people the opportunity to do a special musical number just so you can hit this goal!)\nI currently have 63,307 hymns from 18,218 sacrament meetings. With this data, I can calculate how often wards typically sing intermediate hymns by simply dividing those two numbers. If the number is close to 3, then most wards sing 3 congregational hymns a week, meaning there’s a special musical number or for whatever reason the intermediate hymn is not sung. If the number is close to 4, then most wards sing four congregational hymns: opening, sacrament, intermediate, and closing. As it turns out, it’s around 3.47.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe average number of hymns sung in sacrament meeting is 3.47.\n\n\nThis means that means—across my dataset—only about half of the time does a ward sing an intermediate hymn. If, across a few weeks or months, your ward has a lower number than that, then you have more special musical numbers than a typical ward. If your average is higher, it means you have fewer.\nLet’s recalculate our numbers then. If there are 48 weeks, and 3.47 hymns per week, that’s a max of 167 (I’ll round up) total hymns sung per ward per year. 48 of those are chewed up by the 28 sacrament hymns, so you’re left with 119 slots for the rest of the hymnal. If you didn’t repeat any and add back the 28 sacrament hymns, that’s a max of 147 unique hymns per year. And if you’re only able to get through 2.47 new hymns per week, and there are 282 non-sacrament hymns to get through, it would take 114 weeks to get through all of them, or just about two years and four months."

If you didn’t repeat any and had zero special musical numbers, then yes, you could sing 136 unique hymns, plus the 28 sacrament hymns, for a total of 164 unique hymns per year. That is the maximum any ward could do.\nIf you really were determined to all 310 hymns without repeating, except for sacrament hymns, it would take 94 weeks to do so, or just shy of two years, under perfect conditions. But having special musical numbers and ward choirs makes it impossible to reach that goal. (And I’d encourage you to not deny people the opportunity to do a special musical number just so you can hit this goal!)\nI currently have 63,307 hymns from 18,218 sacrament meetings. With this data, I can calculate how often wards typically sing intermediate hymns by simply dividing those two numbers. If the number is close to 3, then most wards sing 3 congregational hymns a week, meaning there’s a special musical number or for whatever reason the intermediate hymn is not sung. If the number is close to 4, then most wards sing four congregational hymns: opening, sacrament, intermediate, and closing. As it turns out, it’s around 3.47.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe average number of hymns sung in sacrament meeting is 3.47.\n\n\nThis means that means—across my dataset—only about half of the time does a ward sing an intermediate hymn. If, across a few weeks or months, your ward has a lower number than that, then you have more special musical numbers than a typical ward. If your average is higher, it means you have fewer.\nLet’s recalculate our numbers then. If there are 48 weeks, and 3.47 hymns per week, that’s a max of 167 (I’ll round up) total hymns sung per ward per year. 48 of those are chewed up by the 28 sacrament hymns, so you’re left with 119 slots for the rest of the hymnal. If you didn’t repeat any and add back the 28 sacrament hymns, that’s a max of 147 unique hymns per year. And if you’re only able to get through 2.47 new hymns per week, and there are 282 non-sacrament hymns to get through, it would take 114 weeks to get through all of them, or just about two years and four months."

    "text": "So how many hymns do wards sing per year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nMost wards sing around 105 unique hymns per year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical details for nerds :)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get this number, I started off with the 110 wards from which I have at least a year’s worth of data. I didn’t want to base the calculation on wards that contributed less data because it messes with the results.\nBut, even with these 108 wards, I can’t simply divide the number of unique hymns by the number of sacrament meetings because the more data I have from a ward, the more likely they are to repeat hymns, especially common ones and around holidays. Yes, I am also more likely to see an unusual hymn if I have more data from them, but it seems like the repeated hymns has a stronger effect. It appears to follow some sort of exponential distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, because of probability, it’s not meaningful to compare six years of data from one ward to one year of data from another ward.\nI tried a rolling cumulative sum of unique hymns, but I didn’t know how to implement that in R. So instead, I implemented a bootstrapping technique and sampled 48 meetings, without replacement, 100 times per ward, and got that average. The standard deviation was 3.16—a surprisingly narrow distribution if you ask me.\n\n\n\nAssuming about 24–28 of those are sacrament hymns, that means most wards only sing about 80 or so unique non-sacrament hymns per year. It appears then that another 28 of those 80 hymns are repeated each year.\nThe average is around 105, but that doesn’t mean all wards were close to that. 50% of wards were between about 97 and 111 hymns per year. Others do more and others do fewer. If you’re not sure whether your ward has enough variety, count the number of unique hymns in a 1-year period and if it’s in the low 100s, you’re doing alright.\nThe most variety of hymns I have in my dataset is 131 unique hymns per ward. That’s pretty good, and certainly much better than average. The year with the least variety was one ward that sang just 66 unique hymns in a year. Considering that many of the holiday hymns aren’t going to be repeated, it means that many (and perhaps most) of the non-festive hymns were repeated that year.\nThese numbers should be taken with a grain of salt because it’s only based on 108 wards. If you have access to a year’s worth of data from your ward, please visit the contribute page!For what it’s worth, a previous version of this blog post was written based on a much smaller sample of 20 wards. The numbers are more or less the same, which leads me to believe they’re reasonably accurate."

    "text": "Are there fewer intermediate hymns in two-hour church?\nSomeone suggested to me one time that the number of intermediate hymns we sing may have shifted once we switched to two-hour church (and thus a slightly shorter sacrament meeting) in January 2019. In their ward, they sense that intermediate hymns are being sung less, not because of more special musical numbers, but because it cut into the speakers’ talks and there just wasn’t enough time. This is a tricky question to answer because for much of the time since 2019 has been during covid. But, enough time has passed that we can try to answer this question.The Sunday I wrote this section, my ward did this very thing: we had not intermdiate hymn because we had three adult speakers.\nThe following table summaries how many hymns per sacrament meeting were sung in three periods: three-hour church (before January 2019), the “covid era” (March–December 2020), and two-hour church (all of 2019, January–February 2020, and January 2021 through now). Here we can see that the average number of congregational hymns sung in three-hour church was 3.36 and the average number of hymns sung in two-hour church was 3.24—a drop of about 0.12 hymns per week, or about one less intermediate hymn every eight or so weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblocks\nnumber of hymns\nnumber of meetings\nhymns per meeting\n\n\n\n\nthree-hour church\n56248\n16704\n3.367\n\n\ncovid\n300\n116\n2.586\n\n\ntwo-hour church\n5638\n1736\n3.248\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a plot that shows this trend across time, that might shed a little light on these numbers. Since I have data spanning over 20 years, we can see a long period of stability prior to 2019. Covid definitely disrupted the status quo; many ward only sang just one hymn as they resumed in-person meetings. However, 2019 numbers look pretty similar to the years before it. And there has been a noticeable increase since 2021. Only recently does it look to be as high as the pre-2019 era.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, singing only thee congregational hymns on a Sunday instead of four may be because a special musical number took the place of an intermediate hymn. But it could be because the bishopric simply chose not to sing a fourth hymn. With the data I have, I have no way of knowing. I’ll let you interpret these numbers as you will. But, it’s interesting to see the kind of lasting effect that covid had!\nSo, do we have fewer intermediate hymns since we shifted to two-hour church? Yes, but I think it’s because of covid than the length of sacrament meeting."

By this, I mean that, if a hymn is in the key of G major, are there hymns that do not end on a G? As it turns out, there are 16 of them!\nTwelve of these 16 hymns end on the third of the chord. The most common is Thy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188), which is a sacrament hymn, albeit one of the lesser common ones. Most of the others are not unusual and they include ones like The First Noel (#298), Secret Prayer (#225), and Master, the Tempest Is Raging (#105).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First Noel (#213)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimony (#137)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI Know My Father Lives (#302)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecret Prayer (#144)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod Speed the Right (#106)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (#197)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster, the Tempest Is Raging (#105)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, May My Soul Commune with Thee (123)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Ever Pray for Thee (#23)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLean on My Ample Arm (#120)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe Ever Pray for Thee (312)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other four hymns end on the fifth of the chord.

But, because a few sacrament hymns are on this list, as well as several relatively well-known hymns, it’s not a terribly unusual thing to see. In fact, you’re likely to see one of these 16 hymns about once every six weeks or so."

What is more interesting is the two middle parts. The alto line is nearly evenly split between ending on the tonic, the third note of the scale, or the fifth note of the scale, with a very slight preference for the root. Meanwhile, the tenor line ends on the third 64% of the time, and is otherwise evenly split between the root and the fifth. I’m not quite sure what anyone might do with this information, but it’s interesting to see nonetheless!\nOverall, if you were to sing all four parts of all the hymns (again, excluding the men’s and women’s arrangements at the back), you’ll end on the tonic 62.7% of the time, the third 25.0% of the time, and the fifth just 12.3% of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for the next hymnal\n\n\n\nAdd fifths to more final chords."

    "text": "Hymns that end in moving lines\nAnother ending that is pretty unusual is one where not all four parts sing their final note at the same time. In some hymns, at least one part sustains its last note while at least one other part resolves a chord or moves in some other way. There are eight hymns that do this.\nTwo of these hymns, He Died! The Great Redeemer Died (#192) and As the Shadows Fall (#168) end with a Sus4 chord resolving to the tonic chord, with the tenor line responsible for the resolution. The latter of those two has a fifth in the chord, creating some nice close harmony between the tenor and alto line, while the former lacks the fifth and has a more open sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe Died!

In Keep the Commandments (#303), the two inner lines move down and then back up to return to the original notes. In Behold! A Royal Army (#251), they both jump up a fourth and then back down a second, creating a different voicing of the tonic chord than what they started on. In the case of Come unto Jesus (#117), the alto line has a little passing tone.I don’t know enough about music theory to say for sure of the penultimate chord in Keep the Commandments (#303) is a subdominant or something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep the Commandments (#303)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehold!

    "title": "What are the most common final chords?",
    "section": "Final chords",
    "text": "Final chords\nWe now turn to the topic of the final chords themselves, rather than individual parts or notes. As established already, all hymns end in a major or minor chord, so the only options are roots, thirds, and fifths of chords. Logically, there are \\(3\\times 3\\times 3\\times 3=81\\) possible ways to use those three notes, if you ignore octave differences and good musical taste. Of course, the hymnal uses far fewer than that.Since two of the five hymns set in a minor key end in picardy thirds, there are only two hymns that truly end in a minor chord.\nLet me pause briefly to explain the notation I’ll be using. I’ll describe the voicing of the chord using the numbers 1, 3, or 5, from lowest (bass) to highest (soprano). So if we’re in the key of C major, 1-5-3-1 would mean the basses are on a C3, the tenors a G3 above that, the altos on an E4 above that, and the sopranos on a C5 above that. If a part sings in unison with the part below it, I replace its number with an asterisk. This figure shows the twelve configurations found in the hymnal, in order of frequency. Let’s dive into each one of these.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-3-1-* endings\nThe most common voicings to end a hymn on is 1-3-1-*. The bass line ends on the tonic, the tenor a third above, and the alto and soprano lines in unison on the root of the chord (an octave higher). The most common non-sacrament hymn to end on this voicing is Lord, I Would Follow Thee (#220), shown below.\n\n\n\nLord, I Would Follow Thee (#220)\n\n\nAlmost all the hymns that fit this 1-3-1-* description look just like Lord, I Would Follow Thee (#220), but two hymns are slightly different in that the bass note is down an octave. We get this in O My Father (#292) and The Voice of God Again Is Heard (#18).\n\n\n\nO My Father (#292)\n\n\nBecause there are 97 hymns that are voiced as 1-3-1-*, I’m not going to show all of them, but here is a plot that shows the most common ones and how often they are sung in a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we just look at the key signatures of the hymns that fall into this category, we get pretty much all of them. But when we arrange those key signatures in order, we see a pretty clear pattern. Basically, the key of D major is the ideal key to end with this chord, and the closer a key signature is to D, the more likely it is to also use this chord. For keys further away, you’re less likely to see this voicing. For whatever reason, it’s just not ideal to have a hymn in the key of G end with this voicing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lowest version of this voicing are the two hymns in the key of B♭ major, Silent Night (#204) and Joseph Smith’s First Prayer (#26) which are the lowest final notes for the soprano line and as mentioned already are among the lowest soprano notes in the hymnal. Meanwhile, the highest instance is in A♭ in The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37), making that A♭3 the highest note the alto line ends on and the A♭4 the highest final bass note (which probably explains the optional lower note).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Smith’s First Prayer (#26)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilent Night (#204)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (#37)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow often are you likely to see this voicing? Well, since there are 97 hymns that fit this category, including many sacrament hymns, pretty likely. Based on the 17,833 sacrament meetings I have data from, 33.0% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting use this voicing, which means odds are pretty good that on any given Sunday, you’ll see at least one hymn ending in 1-3-1-*.\n\n\n1-3-5-1 endings\nThe 1-3-5-1 ending is basically tied for first place as the most common ending. In its most basic form, it’s a triad with the tonic repeated on top. 96 hymns end with this voicing. One of the most common non-sacrament ones is High on the Mountain Top (#5).\n\n\n\nHigh on the Mountain Top (#5)\n\n\n83 hymns look just like High on the Mountain Top (#5) above. But, like what we saw with 1-3-1-*, there is a subtype where the bass note is down an octave, creating a large interval between the bass and tenor notes. A common one is How Firm a Foundation (#85), which you can see below. Besides this one, there are another 14 hymns with this configuration.\n\n\n\nHow Firm a Foundation (#85)\n\n\nAgain, there are too many hymns that are 1-3-5-1, so I won’t show all of them. But here are plots that show the most common ones and how often they are sung in a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we just look at the key signatures of the hymns that fall into this category, we get 1-3-5-1 endings in most keys. While the 1-3-1-* voicing above appeared to be centered around D major, this one appears to be more common in slightly higher keys. The reason is likely the alto voice: anything lower would put it pretty low. In fact, the one instance in D♭ is in As the Shadows Fall (#168), which makes that A♭3 the lowest final note for the alto line in the hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Shadows Fall (#168)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the differences between the two types (whethe the bass note is high or low), we see that the low bass note version of 1-3-5-1 is most common among hymns in G major, with just a handful scattered among other keys. The one hymn that uses it in E♭ is Thy Holy Word (#279) and has the lowest bass note in the hymnal. The 1-3-5-1 final chord in B♭ also results in the highest final note for a tenor part, a D4 in Let Zion in Her Beauty Rise (#41).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThy Holy Word (#279)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet Zion in Her Beauty Rise (#41)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow often are you likely to see a 1-3-5-1 hymn? Again, there are many of them, including sacrament hymns, so it’s going to be pretty likely. Based on the 17,833 sacrament meetings I have data from, 31.5% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting use this voicing, which means odds are pretty good that, like 1-3-1-* discussed already, you’ll see at least one hymn ending in 1-3-3-5 on any given Sunday.\n\n\n1-1-3-1 endings\nThe next most common way to end a hymn is to use the 1-1-3-1 voicing. The bass, tenor, and soprano line are in three octaves, and the alto line sings the third of the chord below the soprano line. The most common non-sacrament hymn to end on this voicing is For the Beauty of the Earth (#93), shown below.\n\n\n\nFor the Beauty of the Earth (#93)\n\n\nA related ending is the one instance 1-*-1-3 in the hymn Thy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188). That C3 in the tenors is the lowest final tenor note in the hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188)\n\n\n\n\n54 hymns end in 1-1-3-1, so again, I’m not going to show all of them, but this plot shows how often the most common ones are sung in a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the key signatures of the hymns that end in this voicing, we see basically the opposite pattern from 1-3-1-* above. The hymns that use the 1-1-3-1 voicing are mostly in the G, A♭, B♭ range.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lowest iteration of 1-1-3-1 is in F major, which is found in six hymns, three of which are Christmas hymns. The highest version is in C major, as in The Morning Breaks (#1).\nSince there are fewer of these hymns, the odds of seeing them is slightly lower. They made up 15.8% of the dataset that I have, so you’ll likely to sing one about every two weeks.\n\n\n1-5-3-1 endings\nThe final type of final chord that has a significant presence in the hymnal is 1-5-3-1. It also spans two octaves, like other endings, but the voices are more evenly spaced. In my mind, this is the “Ice Cream” voicing because in The Music Man, it’s the chord that the barbershop quartet sings when Herold Hill is teaching them to sing for the first time and he gets them to sing sustained notes while saying “ice cream.” We see this voicing at the end of 42 hymns, including Now Let Us Rejoice (#3).\n\n\n\nNow Let Us Rejoice (#3)\n\n\nI should mention too that Ye Elders of Israel (#319) fits into this category, but the alto is voiced above the soprano line (and thus making it truer to how barbershop is typically voiced).\n\n\n\nNow Let Us Rejoice (#319)\n\n\nHere are the most common hymns that fit this category, sorted by how often they’re sung per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the other final chords we’ve examined so far, it seems like there are some key signatures in which they’re more common. In the case of 1-5-3-1, it’s most common in B♭ major and C major, but we do get it in a handful of other keys as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one hymn in the key of E♭ is What Was Witnessed in the Heavens? (#11). This is the highest version of this chord, and it means the soprano line ends on an E♭5, the highest final soprano note in the hymnal. The lowest version of this chord is in the key of F in We’re Not Ashamed to Own Our Lord (#57), which makes that C4 in the tenors the lowest final tenor note in the hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see those hymns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Was Witnessed in the Heavens? (#11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re Not Ashamed to Own Our Lord (#57)\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there are only 42 of these hymns, again, the odds of seeing them is lower. They made up 11.0% of the dataset that I have, so you’ll likely to sing one about every two or three weeks.\n\n\nNon-tonic soprano final chords\nThe remaining final chord voices are all pretty unusual and are only found in a handful of hymns. We’ve already seen that 16 hymns end the soprano line something other than the tonic and that all hymns end the bass line on the tonic. Of those 16, there are four different voicings. Here, we’ll ignore briefly the two that don’t have full SATB harmonies.\nNine hymns end with 1-5-1-3: We Ever Pray for Thee (#23), Master, the Tempest Is Raging (#105), God Speed the Right (#106), Lean on My Ample Arm (#120), Oh, May My Soul Commune with Thee (#123), Testimony (#137), Secret Prayer (#144), O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (#197), and The First Noel (#213). There is only one other hymn that ends with the melody on the third, Thy Will, O Lord, Be Done (#188) and it has a 1-*-1-3 voicing.I won’t post images of the hymns since these are all shown already.\nOf the hymns that have the melody end on the fifth, there are two voicing configurations. Three hymns use the 1-3-1-5 voicing: Does the Journey Seem Long? (#127), While of These Emblems We Partake (#173), and Carry On (#255). Finally, Now the Day Is Over (159) ends with 1-1-3-5.\n\n\nDuets and Unisons\nA few hymns have specific instructions to sing it as a duet or in unison. I’ll probably do a more thorough treatment of those hymns in a later blog post, but for now, we’ll just focus on how they end.\nThough seven hymns begin as duets, five of them go into full harmony partway through. They are Jesus, Lover of My Soul (#102), I Stand All Amazed (#193), Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd (#221), Let Us Oft Speak Kind Words (#232), and Truth Reflects upon Our Senses (#273). However, two hymns are duets the whole way through. Keep the Commandments (#303) ends in a 3-1 voicing. The other is Love One Another (#308) which is marked as a duet, but at the end breaks into three parts (3-5-1).\nFinally, we get to the hymns that have at least some portion marked as unison. The hymns Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (#118), I Know That My Redeemer Lives (#136), Behold! A Royal Army (#251), and Carry On (#255), start in unison and then break into harmony, so they’ve been discussed above where appropriate. Called to Serve (#249) starts in harmony and then goes to unison. Other stay unison throughout the entirety of the hymn. Come, Rejoice (#9), As Zion’s Youth in Latter Days (#256), Families Can Be Together Forever (#300), I Know My Father Lives (#302), Teach Me to Walk in the Light (#304), God’s Daily Care (#306), and The Priesthood of Our Lord (#320) all end on the tonic while I Know My Father Lives (#302) ends on the third."

    "text": "Summary\nSopranos almost always end on the tonic, and basses always do. Altos end on the root, third, or fifth all about equally, while tenors favor the third. A handful of hymns end with at least one moving part. There are four main final chords the hymnbook uses, with most of the exceptions being from non-tonic-ending soprano lines, duets, and unisons. These main four tend to be used more with certain key signatures, summarized in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I think is coolest finding—and maybe this is old news for musicologists and choral arrangers—is that the final chord voicing is somewhat predictable by the key signature. Hymns in the D♭–d range are often 1-3-1-*, hymns in the E♭–G range are often 1-3-5-1, hymns in the A♭–B♭ range are often 1-1-3-1, and while never the majority, hymns in the B♭–C range are often 1-5-3-1."

    "text": "We’ll start off by looking at sacrament hymns, or rather, the hymn sung immediately before the sacrament is blessed and passed to the congregation. As far as I can tell, §19.3.2 of the General Handbook has the only instruction about sacrament hymns, and it says that “[t]he sacrament hymn should refer to the sacrament itself or to the sacrifice of the Savior.” This instruction is repeated on page 380 of the hymnal.\nAs I’ve written already, I Stand All Amazed (193) is the most common hymn overall. So it should come as no surprise that a sacrament hymn is the most common hymn overall. It focuses less on the sacrament itself and more on the Atonement, so it could be used outside of sacrament contexts without feeling out of place. In fact, a quick look at the numbers suggests that it was, in fact, sung as opening and closing hymns at least three times more often than any other sacrament hymn. This may explain why it stands out as the most commonly sung hymn in sacrament meetings."

    "text": "Non-sacrament hymns\nOnce in a while, a ward will indeed sing some other hymn as a sacrament hymn. Many hymns were selected by at least one ward at least one time, but two stood out. They are O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197) and Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146). There is good reason for why these two were sung as sacrament hymns: if you look up “Sacrament” in the topical index in the back of the hymnal, it is a list of all the hymns from 169–196, but it also includes these two.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start with O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197). It was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every two per ward on average. Given that it feels like a sacrament hymn and like an Easter hymn, it is perfectly placed between the more on-the-nose sacrament hymns (i.e. those about the bread and water) and the more traditional Easter hymns (e.g. He is Risen! (199)). Perhaps some music coordinators noticed it in the Index and chose it because of that. But, I could see a music coordinator selecting it because they perhaps thought sacrament hymns went from 169–197 instead of 169–196.\nThe oddball though is Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146). In fact, it was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every 2.6 years per ward, which is only a little less often than O Thou, Before the World Began (189). It is not clear to me why this one is listed in the index as a sacrament hymn, but it’s not grouped together with the other sacrament hymns. The “Prayer and Supplication” category of hymns, which is what this is a part of (and rightfully so, in my opinion), is just before the “Sacrament” category. If it, like O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197), fits into both categories, then I think it should be moved to hymn 168 so that it’s less out of left field. This one really should be thought of as an honorary sacrament hymn. Perhaps we’ll see it included in the “official” list of sacrament hymns in the next hymnal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation for the next hymnal\n\n\n\nConsider putting O Thou, Before the World Began (189) immediately before the list of sacrament hymns."

Unsurprisingly, I Stand All Amazed (193) is at the top, being sung occasionally as an opening hymn and closing hymn. At only once every 5–6 years, it’s not particularly common to see it sung this way, but it’s still not unheard of. After that, there are a few others like ’Tis Sweet to Sing the Matchless Love (177) and Reverently and Meekly Now (185) were also used as one of the other hymns, but it was still quite unusual.\nOverall, while singing a specific sacrament hymn elsewhere in the meeting is pretty unusual, the odds of singing any of the sacrament hymns is more common since their frequencies add together. It happened in 226 of the 17,833 sacrament meetings I have data from, or 1.3% of them. That means, on average, a ward might since hymn 169–196 at some other point in the meeting approximately once every year and 8 months."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe findings in this section suggest that were have a strong tradition of singing hymns 169 through 196 in our sacrament meetings immediately before the sacrament itself. Some wards systematically cycle through them, which I believe is a perfectly appropriate thing to do to include the widest variety of hymns to the ward. Other wards pick and choose, which inevitably leads to some favorites being sung more and some lesser-known ones falling through the cracks.\nAs we’ll see when we look at holidays, wards do not always stick to the table of contents at the beginning of the hymnal when choosing appropriate hymns. However, in the case of the sacrament—which is the most important part of our Sunday worship and the primary reason for Sunday gatherings—it’s clear that we adhere strongly to the recommendation. Nevertheless, the addition of Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146) shows that there is at least some room for thinking out of the box when selecting sacrament hymns."

The modern hymnal tends to use key signatures that have few sharps or flats. There are about as many hymns in the D major as there are in C major and E♭ major. There are slightly fewer hymns in F and B♭ major for some reason. E♭ major is the standout because even though it has more flats than B♭ and F, it outnumbers those two.

Presumably they got rid of those because they were too hard for some accompanists to play.\nTwo key signatures are marginal in the hymnal.

As the Shadows Fall (#168) was sung just 11 times in my data, or once every roughly 35 years. The other, Softly Beams the Sacred Dawning (#56), was sung just five times in my sample, meaning it’s sung about once every 76 years. Because of how unusual these hymns are, these numbers are very rough guesses; perhaps we can think of them as “once in a generation” and “once in a lifetime.” The point is, it is very unusual to sing a hymn in D♭.\nFor what it’s worth, there is one hymn that actually changes keys partway though. Welcome, Welcome, Sabbath Morning (#280) starts in C major, shifts to G major, and then back to C major. For the purposes of this study, I’m treating it as being in C major the entire time."

    "text": "But do we actually see G major the most?\nSo we’ve addressed the question of what key signature the most number of hymns are set to. But, does that actually mean that’s the most that we see? What’s the difference? It may be the case that tons of hymns in G major are really obscure ones that hardly anyone ever sees. So, if we take frequency into account, perhaps another key is seen more often, even if fewer hymns are actually in it.\n(An analogy here is that Figure 1 is like the Senate: equal representation of all states, regardless of population. In this case, all hymns are treated equally, regardless of how often they’re sung. Figure 2 is like the House of Representatives: representation based on population, or in this case, how often a hymn is sung.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Frequency of key signatures, weighted based on hymn popularity\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 looks similar to Figure 1 except I’ve adjusted the heights of the bars based on how frequent each hymn is. If a hymn is more common, it’ll raise the bar for its key signature more. If it’s less common, it’ll raise it less.\nWhile superficially the two plots may look similar, there are some important differences. (See Table 1 as well.) First, D major is closer in height to G major. While only about 16.5% of the hymns are in D, they’re sung about 18.3% of the time. This is likely due to some pretty common sacrament hymns like Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (#196), O God, the Eternal Father (#175), and In Memory of the Crucified (#190) as well as some other heavy hitters like I Believe in Christ (#134) and We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (#19).\nMost of the other key signatures are pretty similar. C major and F major are more or less unchanged. Though 11.47% of hymns are set in B♭ major, they’re only sung about 10.34% of the time. And while A♭ major is only used in 5.59% of the hymns, it’s sung 4.85% of the time in sacrament meeting. (No doubt, I Stand All Amazed (#193) is doing the lion’s share of the work there.)\nPerhaps the biggest change is that E♭ is a bit more commonly seen than you’d expect based on how many hymns there are in it. 14.41% of hymns are in E♭, but 16.91% of the hymns actually sung in sacrament meeting are in E♭. Undoubtedly, it’s because nine of the 28 sacrament hymns are in E♭. So, to put it another way, on average, hymns in E♭ major are more common than hymns in C major or even B♭ major.\nFinally, the fact that the keys of A and D♭ major are mere slivers in Figure 2 reflects what was explained above that they’re really uncommon.\nFigure 2 probably has the most useful application out of anything else in this blog post. If you’re a budding musician and are still getting used to key signatures, the good news is that you don’t have to learn all twelve keys to play the hymnal. If you focus your efforts on hymns in G, D, and E♭, you’ll get the most mileage out of your practice.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Key signature frequencies\n\n\nKey Signature\n# of hymns\n% of hymnal\n% of hymns sung\n\n\n\n\nA\n2\n0.59%\n0.14%\n\n\nD\n56\n16.47%\n18.34%\n\n\nG\n76\n22.35%\n21.51%\n\n\nC\n49\n14.41%\n13.97%\n\n\nF\n48\n14.12%\n13.90%\n\n\nBb\n39\n11.47%\n10.34%\n\n\nEb\n49\n14.41%\n16.91%\n\n\nAb\n19\n5.59%\n4.85%\n\n\nDb\n2\n0.59%\n0.03%"

    "text": "Why is G major the most common?\nI’m not a musicologist, but I can speculate as to why G is more common than C. It may be the case that many melodies are centered around the tonic, and extend roughly a fifth above it and roughly a fourth or fifth below it, with a total range of about an octave. If that’s the case, and a comfortable octave for many singers is from D to D, that means the key of G would be an appropriate key signature. A good example of this is Love One another (#308), in the left panel of Figure 3, which shows the distribution of notes in the melody, with the tonic highlighted in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Soprano ranges for two representative hymns\n\n\n\n\nOther melodies also span a full octave but the highest and lowest notes are the tonic itself. A good example of this is All Creatures of Our God and King (#62), the right panel of Figure 3. For melodies such as these, a key signature like D (or in this case, E♭) would be more appropriate so that the melody does not go too high or too low.\nSo, it may be the case then that the reason why G major is the most common key is because there are more melodies like Love One another (#308) than like All Creatures of Our God and King (#62). (Looking through plots like what you see in Figure 3, but for all the hymns in the key of G, it seems like pretty much all of them look similar to Love One another (#308).)\nAlong similar lines, if a piece is set to the key of G, the basses get to end the piece on a strong low note that many men, particularly men who sing bass lines, can hit. It’s nice to end a piece with the tonic being the lowest note of the bass line, and the entire hymn. Some examples of these hymns include Do What is Right (#237) (shown in the left panel of Figure 4) and God, Our Father, Hear Us Pray (#170). Other hymns, such as those set in C major or B♭ major, have the dominant (or fifth note of the scale) as the lowest note of the bass line, sometimes near the very end of the piece, like in Silent Night (#203) (shown in the right panel of Figure 4) or The Spirit of God (#2). While dropping down to a low dominant (in this case F if it’s in the key of B♭) can be a nice way to close a piece, I think a stronger finish is to end with the lowest note being the dominant, hence the greater number of hymns set in the key of G.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Bass ranges for two representative hymns"

    "text": "What about minor keys?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nExactly five hymns are set in a minor key.\n\n\nYou can see the five hymns in a minor key in Figure 5. The most common is the New Year’s Day hymn, Ring Out, Wild Bells (#215). We’ll talk more about holidays later on, but it’s only sung by 45% of wards around New Year’s Day. The next most common is If You Could Hie to Kolob (#284) although it’s not especially frequent and is only sung about once every 3.1 years or so. Third is That Easter Morn (#198) which, from my intuition, is punching above its weight because only 22% of wards sing it around Easter. The last two, Lord, We Come Before Thee Now (#162) and How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True? (#126) are pretty unusual and are sung about once every 15 years and once every 48 years or so, respectively.Although, if your ward ever does one of those musical testimony meetings where people get up and say what their favorite hymn is and then everyone sings a verse of that, I suspect you’re pretty much guaranteed to sing it then.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Frequency of hymns in a minor key\n\n\n\n\nSo, if you sing a hymn in a minor key, it’s probably one of the two holiday ones or If You Could Hie to Kolob (#284). I can’t help but think that the reason If You Could Hie to Kolob (#284) is so popular is because it’s set in a minor key. It’s a pretty obscure piece of doctrine that it’s talking about and I wonder if it were set to a different tune if it’d be as popular. In other words, do people like it because of the words or because of the music? Also, for what it’s worth, the distribution of notes looks very much like Love One another (#308) (the left panel in Figure 3).In fact, it was set to a different tune, in a major key, in the 1948 hymnal. It’s hymn #257. I don’t know how popular it was prior to 1985 though."

What I mean is that for every part (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) for every hymn, I went through and wrote down the pitch and duration of every note in a spreadsheet. With this music now reduced down to numbers, I can analyze it quantitatively. This post is the first of many that will present a numeric analysis of the music of the hymns themselves. I’ve started with the soprano line since it’s what is most familiar to most people, but I’ll eventually do similar posts on alto, tenor, and bass lines as well."

    "text": "Highest melody notes\nThe first question we can ask is this: what is the highest note a melody goes up to?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe highest (non-optional) melody note is an F♯5, which is found in Lean on My Ample Arm (120).\n\n\nThat of course excludes the optional G5 at the end of Carry On (255). What’s worse about the the F♯5 in Lean on My Ample Arm (120) is that it’s a sustained note—there’s nowhere to hide! However, it is very unlikely that you’ll sing it in church. In all the data I have, it was only sung four times, which means it’s sung about once every 29 years. Another way of putting it is that the hymn is sung in sacrament meeting about once a generation. So, if you can’t quite reach that F♯5, don’t worry because you will likely never need to.For what it’s worth, a combined choir from BYU sang it in General Conference in April 2008 and it was beautiful.\nWell then, what is a typical highest note for a soprano line?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe majority of hymns have D5 as their highest note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighest Note\nNumber of Hymns\nPercentage of Hymnal\n\n\n\n\nAb4\n2\n0.61%\n\n\nBb4\n1\n0.31%\n\n\nB4\n2\n0.61%\n\n\nC5\n30\n9.17%\n\n\nC#5\n6\n1.83%\n\n\nD5\n164\n50.15%\n\n\nEb5\n62\n18.96%\n\n\nE5\n54\n16.51%\n\n\nF5\n5\n1.53%\n\n\nF#5\n1\n0.31%\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are another five hymns that have melody lines that go up to an F5. But, as seen below, the only one that is moderately common is The Morning Breaks (1). The others are sung so infrequently, that their presence in sacrament meetings is negligible. Great Is the Lord (77) was sung just four times in my sample and both The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37) and Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (118) were each sung only twice. And Sweet Is the Work (317) is a women’s choir arrangement so, as I’ve discussed already, it’s not sung very much.\n\nHymns with melodies that go up to an F5\n\n\nHymn\nHow often it’s sung\n\n\n\n\nThe Morning Breaks (1)\nOnce every 3.5 years\n\n\nGreat Is the Lord (77)\nOnce every 30 years\n\n\nThe Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37)\nOnce every 60 years\n\n\nYe Simple Souls Who Stray (118)\nOnce every 60 years\n\n\nSweet Is the Work (317)\nNever?\n\n\n\nSo, six of the 341 hymns on our current hymnal go up to an F5 or F♯5, which is 1.76% of the hymnal. If all hymns were sung equally often as each other, we’d then expect that 1.76% of sacrament meeting hymns to go up to an F5 or F♯5. In reality, only 0.24% of them do, which means these six hymns are less common than expected. On average, you’ll encounter one maybe once every two and a half years. And if you do, three-quarters of the time it’ll be The Morning Breaks (1).\nI can’t help but wonder whether that high melody note is the reason these hymns are so uncommon. It may be the case that they are unusual hymns anyway that for whatever reason are not sung very often. But I think that these hymns are uncommon at least partially because of these high notes. A music coordinator might consider selecting one of these for their ward to sing in sacrament meeting, but for the sake of everyone’s voices, ultimately decides against it. Thus, the high note perpetuates the rarity of the hymn. We saw this with the key signatures as well: hymns with marginally-attested phenomena (in this case, the keys of A and Db) are rarer than they would be due to chance alone."

There are only 6 that go up to a C♯ or D♭, including Because I Have Been Given Much (219). The figure below shows all of them and how often they occur. It’s interesting that even though there are six hymns that fall into this category, two are sacrament hymns and one is a very common one. So even though they make up just 1.76% of the hymnal, they make up about 2.65% of the hymns sung in church. You’re likely to see one every 11 or so weeks on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think there are relatively few that have this particular note simply because of what key signatures are most common. It’s probably not a coincidence that one of the two hymns in D♭ are in this category. Most of the others are in A♭. If there were more hymns in D♭ major, or even A♭ we might see more hymns where the highest note is D♭5.\nAnother 30 hymns only go as high as a C5, including Choose the Right (239) and Come, Follow Me (116). They make up 8.8% of the hymnal but 11.7% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are five hymns don’t ever go higher than the middle of the treble clef. The two that only go to a B4 are both pretty well known: Secret Prayer (144) and Lead, Kindly Light (197). The only one that has B♭4 as the highest note is for men, Ye Who Are Called to Labor (321), so it might not even count as a “soprano” note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact\n\n\n\nThe lowest highest melody note is an A♭4, which is found in the rare God Moves in a Mysterious Way (285) and the extremely rare Now the Day is Over (159).\n\n\nThese two hymns are low enough that even a good tenor could sing the melody in the right octave! In total, there are just five hymns that don’t reach a C5, which is only 1.5% of the hymnal. And they’re rarer hymns, so they only make up 0.72% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting. So, if your highest note is a B, you might be able to sing melody once every 10 months or so. At least these lower hymns are more common that the hymns that go up to an F5 or F♯5!"

So, if I were in charge, I’d selfishly transpose many of these hymns down a bit so that their highest note is in a more comfortable range for me.

    "text": "October is peak Primary Program season. According to the Handbook, the “Children’s Sacrament Meeting Presentation” is held annually “during the last few months of the year.” The wards I’ve been in typically do it in October or late September. So, since we’re approaching the end of October, I thought I’d take a look at what congregational hymns are sung around this time of year, likely as a result of the Primary Program. It’s a little difficult to see what hymns are sung the most in October, because we have several other things going on, including General Conference and a Fast Sunday. So, if we ignore those for now, we can start to see what hymns emerge as being the most autumnal hymn.\nThe following table shows the top ten most common hymns sung in October, excluding sacrament hymns and General Conference–related hymns. The numbers are not huge—it’s not like we’re seeing a very obvious trend going on across the church. But, it is probably not a coincidence that I Am a Child of God (#301) and Teach Me to Walk in the Light (#304) are among the Top 3. These are most likely related to the Primary Programs.\nHymn\nWards that sang it in October\n\n\n\n\nI Am a Child of God (301)\n4.63%\n\n\nCome, Follow Me (116)\n4.17%\n\n\nTeach Me to Walk in the Light (304)\n4.17%\n\n\nI Know That My Redeemer Lives (136)\n3.65%\n\n\nBecause I Have Been Given Much (219)\n3.52%\n\n\nHow Firm a Foundation (85)\n3.13%\n\n\nI Believe in Christ (134)\n3.13%\n\n\nChoose the Right (239)\n3.13%\n\n\nLord, I Would Follow Thee (220)\n3.06%\n\n\nThe Spirit of God (2)\n2.87%\nBut, raw frequency doesn’t tell the whole story. You can see on this list that the other eight of the top ten most common hymns in October are hymns that are common throughout the year. In other words, of course Because I Have Been Given Much (#219) is common in October: it’s the most common non-sacrament hymn! In fact, those eight other hymns are among the top 13 most common non-sacrament hymns. So, this table doesn’t say too much by itself.\nSo, as a way to control for how popular a hymn is overall, I’ve done a different calculation that accounts for how much the hymn is sung within a particular range compared to not within a range.\nThe following table shows the hymns that are quite a bit more likely to be sung in October than in other months of the year.\nHymn\nSung in October\nPercent of October\nSung not in October\nPercent not in October\nTimes more likely in October\n\n\n\n\nI Am a Child of God (301)\n71\n1.36%\n313\n0.53%\n2.55\n\n\nAs I Search the Holy Scriptures (277)\n40\n0.77%\n224\n0.38%\n2.01\n\n\nTeach Me to Walk in the Light (304)\n64\n1.23%\n389\n0.66%\n1.85\n\n\nCome, Follow Me (116)\n64\n1.23%\n396\n0.68%\n1.82\nAs you can see I Am a Child of God (#301) makes the cut and it sung 2.55 times more likely to be sung in October than elsewhere during the year. Another children’s hymn, Teach Me to Walk in the Light (#304), is about 1.85 times as likely. As for the two other hymns, As I Search the Holy Scriptures (#277) and Come, Follow Me (#116), it’s not obvious to me why those might be sung more in October than in other months.\nFor what it’s worth, there are other children’s hymns that are more common in October, but didn’t make the cut because they’re more common during other months.\nThe following plot shows these select children’s hymns and how often they were sung throughout the year.\nSo, other I Am a Child of God (#301) appears to be the most October-concentrated hymn. A few other children hymns are also popular, but they’re either not frequent enough to be statistically significant, or they’re overshadowed by their usage in other parts of the year."

    "text": "Project Overview\nHave you ever wondered what the most common hymn is in sacrament meeting? I can tell you right now: it’s I Stand All Amazed (193) and it’s sung, on average, once every 4.4 months in a given ward. What hymn is least common? Well, that’s a trickier question to answer, but if you ignore the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal, some of the least common hymns in sacrament meeting are Sons of Michael, He Approaches (51), This House We Dedicate to Thee (245), Go, Ye Messengers of Glory (262), and God Save the King (341).\nWhat is the most popular Christmas hymn? It looks like it’s Joy to the World (201). If that matches your intuition, then that’s good news because it’s means I’ve got good data! But, what is the most popular Mother’s Day hymn? Thanksgiving? Valentine’s Day?\nWith this project, I have been able to answer some of these simpler questions, but I’ve also been able to uncover some subtler patterns as well. Like, what Christmas hymns are typically sung the third Sunday in December? (The First Noel (213) might be the most likely.) On the Sunday after Thanksgiving (in the United States), do people sing more Thanksgiving hymns, Christmas hymns, or neither? Are there “unofficial” sacrament hymns that are sung more than any of the “official” ones? What percentage of wards outside of Utah (but still in the US) sing Pioneer Day hymns around Pioneer Day?\nI’ve also uncovered some of what might go through a music coordinator’s head as they select what hymns are to be sung in their ward. It seems like the more popular Christmas hymns are reserved for Sundays when it is anticipated that the most number of people will be in attendance, and the less popular ones are used during peak travel dates. Even though the entry for “Thanksgiving” in topic index in the back of the hymnal directs readers to the “Gratitude” for more hymns, very few people actually use those gratitude-themed hymns around Thanksgiving. Easter hymns trump both General Conference– and Fast Sunday–themed hymns in April, and Fourth of July trumps Fast Sunday hymns.\nFurthermore, I’ve been able to uncover patterns that say something interesting about Mormon culture. For example, Mother’s Day hymns are typically about earthly mothers while Father’s Day hymns are about Heavenly Father. Enough Utahns have relocated to other parts of the US that Pioneer Day may be considered a de facto LDS holiday. And a decent number of wards systematically cycle through the 28 sacrament hymns, sometimes for years without any deviation.\nAs a secondary part of this project, I’m also addressing questions about the music of the hymns. What hymn has the highest melody note? Well, if you exclude the women’s arrangements in the back of the hymnal and the optional note at the end of Carry On (255), it’s the F# in the rarely-sung Lean on My Ample Arm (120). What part has the narrowest range? What is the most common key signature? How many hymns could you sing the tenor line for if you can only go up to a Bb? What is the most common final chord? How many hymns don’t end on “do”? How many add9 chords are there in the hymnal?"

A pipe dream if there ever was one. But I have been able to get enough data to the point where I believe I’ve hit a critical mass. It’s more than a lifetime’s worth of sacrament meetings for any one person (even if you attend multiple sacrament meetings for a few decades), and enough to uncover some pretty subtle patterns.\nI am a linguistics professor at BYU, which means I am not a statistician or musicologist, though I do have some training in both statistics and music. What qualifies me for this project are my skills in data analysis and vizualization, as well as my sheer interest in the project.\nI’m motivated to complete this project soon because the church will soon release a new hymnal, at which point all of my data will be obsolete. I hope that I can get these results out there so that people can use it help them with their callings, so the church can use it when designing the new hymnal, and to provide a snapshot of hymn usage data before the 1985 hymnal is phased out.\nI’ve been primary pianist twice and sacrament accompanist twice, but not for too long because I find myself getting called to other positions.
