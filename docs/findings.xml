  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p><a href="../../posts/most_common_hymns">Previously</a>, I’ve posted about the most popular hymns. In this post, I’ll look at the opposite end of the spectrum: what hymns are hardly ever sung at all? Ones that, if they end up being cut from the hymnal, hardly anyone would even notice.</p>

<p>I will update the results on this page from time to time as I collect more data. The first update happened just a few hours after my original post because I had recieved an additional 10 years of data from generous contributors.</p>
</div>
</div>
<section id="a-brief-note-about-my-calculations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-brief-note-about-my-calculations">A brief note about my calculations</h2>
<p>Let me first mention my methods for how I’m calculating how often a hymn is sung, on average, per ward. I currently have data from 6,122 sacrament meetings. A ward will meet together for sacrament meeting usually 48 times in a year (52 weeks minus two for General Conference and minus two for Stake Conference). 6,122 meetings divided by 48 meetings in a year is about 127 years’ worth of sacrament meetings—more than any one person would likely attend in their lifetime, even if you doubled up for a couple decades. So, if there’s a hymn that’s sung in just one of those sacrament meetings, that means it’s sung, on average per ward, once every 127 years. If a hymn is sung 100 times in my dataset, it’s sung on average once every <code>6122 / 48 / 100 =</code> 1.27 years per ward.</p>
<p>Because I’m dealing with very sparse numbers in this post, the numbers may fluctuate wildly. So for example, a hymn that’s sung in three of my sacrament meetings comes out to an average of once every 42.5 years. Meanwhile a hymns that’s sung in just two of them is once every 63.8 years. That’s a big jump for a single data point. So, what I’m saying is you should take these numbers with a large grain of salt they mostly reflect how much data I have. Instead, I’ll group them into broad categories of “once a decade,” “once a generation,” and “once in a lifetime.”</p>
<p>Please note that I have removed the men’s and women’s arrangements (hymns 309–337) from these lists because, as I’ve <a href="../../mens_womens_arrangements">already written</a>, they’re probably not really intended or appropriate for sacrament meeting.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, let’s most on to the least common hymns.</p>
</section>
<section id="once-a-decade" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="once-a-decade">Once a decade</h2>
<p>Let’s start with hymns that are sung once every 10 to about 25 years or so. In other words, these are ones that were sung between about 5 to 12 times in the entire sample. In my current dataset, there are 33 hymns that fit into this category. The following table shows these hymns in order of appearance in the hymnal.</p>

<p>As an LDS musician basically my entire life, I can tell you that I could probably sing the melody for two of these: <hymn>What Was Witnessed in the Heavens? (11)</hymn> and <hymn>Should You Feel Inclined to Censure (235)</hymn>. Most of the hymns in the first half the hymnal, I hardly recognize at all. Meanwhile, the ones in the second half of the hymnal are ones that I recognize only because they’re interspersed among some of the more common, upbeat hymns in the 200-range. Overall, there is nothing too surprising here: there aren’t any hymns that I feel like are more popular than they really are.</p>
</section>
<section id="once-a-generation" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="once-a-generation">Once a generation</h2>
<p>The next table shows ones that are sung about once every <em>generation</em> or two. I’m defining these are those that are sung, on average per ward, once every 25 to 45 years. In my data, they show up in just 3–4 sacrament meetings. There are 18 hymns in this category, which you can see in the following table.</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Among this set of hymns, I only recognize a few, and not because I’ve sung them in church, but because they stand out for other reasons. First, is <hymn>Lean on My Ample Arm (120)</hymn> which is my favorite hymn. There’s <hymn>Softly Now the Light of Day (160)</hymn> which, at only two lines and one verse, is tied with the once-every-seven-years <hymn>Praise God, from Whom All Blessings Flow (242)</hymn> for the shortest hymn in the hymnal.. There’s also <hymn>As the Shadows Fall (168)</hymn>, which I recognize because it’s one of <a href="../../posts/key_signatures.html">only two hymns in the key of D♭</a>. As far as the rest go, I don’t even recognize the titles for a lot of them.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">If you want to get really technical, Hymn 242 is shorter because its suggested tempo marking includes slower tempos.</span></div></div>
<p>The wild thing is that the current hymnal was published in 1985, which is 38 years ago. If these numbers are accurate, it means that these hymns might have been sung maybe once or twice in the entire lifetime of the hymnal!</p>

<p>Finally, we get to the eighteen hymns that are sung at most two times in the 6,122 sacrament meetings I have data from. Again, keep in mind that because I’m dealing with such sparse data, saying something is sung once every 127 years is very approximate and just reflects how much data I have total. Instead, you should just think of these hymns as being sung once-in-a-lifetime.</p>

<p>If the previous category of hymns (the “once in a generation” ones) were rare, these are even rarer. Another way of thinking about these is that in the lifetime of a physical copy of a hymnal, there is a decent chance that most of these nine hymns were <em>ever</em> sung.</p>
<p>Some of these can be explained a little bit.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Here we get <a href="../../posts/key_signatures.html">the other hymn in D♭</a>, <hymn>Softly Beams the Sacred Dawning (56)</hymn>.</p></li>
<li><p>I like to describe <hymn>The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37)</hymn> as being “famous for not being famous,” particularly among LDS musicians, and with its <a href="../../posts/highest_melody">high melody</a> and tenor lines, unusual chords, and potentially offensive lyrics, it’s no surprise that it’s not sung very often.</p></li>
<li><p><hymn>We Meet Again in Sabbath School (282)</hymn> makes sense for being on this list because it’s likely intended to be an opening hymn for Sunday School, and not sacrament meeting. Although, we don’t start Sunday School with hymns anymore, so it’s likely not getting any currency anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>The hymn <hymn>Come, Let Us Sing an Evening Hymn (167)</hymn> makes sense since most wards meet in the morning.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s also not surprising that <hymn>God Save the King (341)</hymn> isn’t represented in my sample, partially because I only have data from a single ward in the United Kingdom, and while it was several years’ worth, it is just one ward <em>and</em> the reigning monarch the entire time was a queen rather than a king.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, it seems like <hymn>This House We Dedicate to Thee (245)</hymn> is intended for a building dedication which probably not very many people actually get to attend in their lifetimes. It’s a perfectly good hymn and very appropriate for the occasion—but regular sacrament meeting is not such an occasion.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="overall-frequency" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overall-frequency">Overall Frequency</h2>
<p>To me, it is wild to think that these 18 hymns (plus many of the men’s and women’s arrangements) have been printed in tens of thousands of hymnals for the past nearly 40 years and have hardly ever been used by anyone. On the plus side, these lists are somewhat small, especially the list of hymns never sung at all. It appears to be the case then that pretty much every hymn is sung at least a little bit. So, inflated claims along the lines of “there are 100 hymns that literally no one sings” simply aren’t accurate. They’re not common, but they are sung.</p>
<p>In fact, if we take all 65 hymns that I’ve listed on this page, and count up how many times they were sung, it comes out to 363 times in this sample, which is 1.78% of all the data. That means you might sing one of these 65 hymns once every four months, or about as often as <a href="../../posts/most_common_hymns.html"><hymn>I Stand All Amazed (193)</hymn></a>. Another way of thinking about it is that we could cut these 65 hymns, and it would affect about one meeting every four months.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Perhaps a better way of looking at this is to think about how many wards sing a given hymn around the world. There are around 31,330 wards and branches across the world. Let’s say that the 6,122 meetings I have data from are a representative sample. That’s 19.5% of the congregations around the whole world. If one of them sings something like <hymn>Like Ten Thousand Legions Marching (253)</hymn>, we might therefore assume that perhaps five congregations around the world will sing that hymn in a given week. For comparison, if we apply the same logic, <hymn>I Stand All Amazed (193)</hymn> would be sung in 1,857 different congregations every week.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">See more facts and figures published by the church <a href="https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/country/united-states">here</a>.</span></div></div>

<p>You should take that claim about how many wards around the world sing these hymns with a monster grain of salt for at least the following reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The wards I have data from are not representative of units across the world. Roughly 75% of my data comes from the US, for example, while less than half the congregations in the world come from the US.</p></li>
<li><p>We can’t assume the 5,659 meetings are independent of each other because most wards contributed data from more than one sacrament meeting. So we can’t interpret them as coming from 5,659 independent wards in the same week.</p></li>
<li><p>As we’ll see in later posts, holidays matter, and the likelihood of singing any one hymn goes up and down depending on things like holidays, Fast Sundays, and proximity to <a href="../../posts/general_conference.html">General Conference</a>. So the odds of singing these unusual hymns is basically zero the week before Christmas, but slightly higher in a random week in September or something.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, the type of music coordinators that keep spreadsheets are likely the ones who try to diversify the hymns they sing. There are likely many wards who do not have spreadsheets and may sing from a more limited selection throughout the year.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted to point out these caveats, but it’s still interesting to think about how many times these hymns are sung around the world on a given Sunday.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>In this blog post, I took a closer look at hymns that are sung at most once a decade. Many of them were sung less often that that, if they were sung at all.</p>
<p>But <em>should</em> we cut these hymns? Unless there are issues with the text, message, or doctrine, I don’t see any reason why we should remove hymns <em>per se</em>. In fact, some hymns, like <hymn>We Meet Again in Sabbath School (282)</hymn> or <hymn>This House We Dedicate to Thee (245)</hymn> are/were quite appropriate in very specific, albeit infrequent, circumstances. So, should they be printed in tens of thousands of hymnals? In my opinion, probably not.</p>

<p>Put these special hymns into an online supplement to the hymnal, like <a href="../../posts/mens_womens_arrangements.html#my-recommendations-for-the-next-hymnal">what I recommend for the men’s and women’s arrangements</a>. Make it clear that these are approved for use in the church and part of the “canon” but are simply not printed for practical reasons.</p>
<p>As for the special hymns that are useful for certain occasions, set them aside in a section called “special occasions” or something that would catch people’s attention. We don’t want them to be overlooked when those special occasions do arise. It would be a shame to lose these hymns simply because the occasions they are written for don’t happen very often.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that many people in your ward will be familiar with more than a few hymns listed on this page. If you want to be adventurous and try a really uncommon hymm, these are the ones to choose from. But, it might be good to help the ward out a little bit by having the ward choir sing it first, having the organist play it for prelude a few weeks prior, having the organist play the entire hymn as an introduction, and having the organist use play the melody on the swell (or use a melody coupler) with a reed stop pulled to make it easier to hear.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you use these hymns, you should get familiar with these techniques for introducing hymns to ward members because we’ll all likely need to start using them when we get the new hymnal anyway.</p>

</div>
<p>If you have sung one of these 65 hymns recently in your ward, that’s pretty cool because few people can sasy they have!</p>

  <title>What are the highest notes in the melodies?</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>In addition to collecting data on how often hymns are sung in sacrament meeting, I have also gone through the rather painstaking process of quantifying all the actual music of the hymns. What I mean is that for every part (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) for every hymn, I went through and wrote down the pitch and duration of every note in a spreadsheet. With this music now reduced down to numbers, I can analyze it quantitatively. This post is the first of many that will present a numeric analysis of the music of the hymns themselves. I’ve started with the soprano line since it’s what is most familiar to most people, but I’ll eventually do similar posts on alto, tenor, and bass lines as well.</p>
<section id="highest-melody-notes" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="highest-melody-notes">Highest melody notes</h2>
<p>The first question we can ask is this: what is the highest note a melody goes up to?</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The highest (non-optional) melody note is an F♯5, which is found in <hymn>Lean on My Ample Arm (120)</hymn>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>That of course excludes the optional G5 at the end of <hymn>Carry On (255)</hymn>. What’s worse about the the F♯5 in <hymn>Lean on My Ample Arm (120)</hymn> is that it’s a sustained note—there’s nowhere to hide! However, it is very unlikely that you’ll sing it in church. In all the data I have, it was only sung four times, which means it’s sung about once every 29 years. Another way of putting it is that the hymn is sung in sacrament meeting about once a generation. So, if you can’t quite reach that F♯5, don’t worry because you will likely never need to.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">For what it’s worth, a combined choir from BYU sang it in General Conference in April 2008 and it was beautiful.</span></div></div>

<p>There are another five hymns that have melody lines that go up to an F5. But, as seen below, the only one that is moderately common is <hymn>The Morning Breaks (1)</hymn>. The others are sung so infrequently, that their presence in sacrament meetings is negligible. <hymn>Great Is the Lord (77)</hymn> was sung just four times in my sample and both <hymn>The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (37)</hymn> and <hymn>Ye Simple Souls Who Stray (118)</hymn> were each sung only twice. And <hymn>Sweet Is the Work (317)</hymn> is a women’s choir arrangement so, <a href="../../posts/mens_womens_arrangements.html">as I’ve discussed already</a>, it’s not sung very much.</p>

<p>So, six of the 341 hymns on our current hymnal go up to an F5 or F♯5, which is 1.76% of the hymnal. If all hymns were sung equally often as each other, we’d then expect that 1.76% of sacrament meeting hymns to go up to an F5 or F♯5. In reality, only 0.24% of them do, which means these six hymns are less common than expected. On average, you’ll encounter one maybe once every two and a half years. And if you do, three-quarters of the time it’ll be <hymn>The Morning Breaks (1)</hymn>.</p>
<p>I can’t help but wonder whether that high melody note is the reason these hymns are so uncommon. It may be the case that they are unusual hymns anyway that for whatever reason are not sung very often. But I think that these hymns are uncommon at least partially because of these high notes. A music chairperson might consider selecting one of these for their ward to sing in sacrament meeting, but for the sake of everyone’s voices, ultimately decides against it. Thus, the high note perpetuates the rarity of the hymn. We saw this with the <a href="../../posts/key_signatures.html">key signatures</a> as well: hymns with marginally-attested phenomena (in this case, the keys of A and Db) are rarer than they would be due to chance alone.</p>

<p>Okay, so melodies that go up to an F5 or higher are just not that common. Once we start looking at the E5 and E♭5 territory, there are many more hymns that include notes in that range, and some of those hymns are pretty common.</p>
<p>There are 54 hymns have E5 as the highest note in their melody, including some of the more common ones like <hymn>High on the Mountain Top (5)</hymn>, <hymn>Our Savior’s Love (113)</hymn>, <hymn>Let Us All Press On (243)</hymn>, and <hymn>Praise to the Man (27)</hymn>. Collectively, these 54 hymns make up 15.84% of the hymnal. 12.21% of the hymns sung in my sample of sacrament meetings are one of these 54, so you’ll see an E5 about once every 2.5 weeks. The following figure shows these hymns in order of frequency and how often they’re sung.</p>

</div>
<p>As far as hymns that have E♭5 as the highest note, there are 58 of them, or 18.18% of the hymns. Some of the more common ones include <hymn>I Stand All Amazed (193)</hymn>, <hymn>The Spirit of God (2)</hymn> and a handful of other sacrament hymns. The following table shows these hymns in order of frequency and how often they’re sung.</p>

<p>In total, 115 hymns, or 35.9% of the hymnal go up to an E<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cflat"> or higher.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="typical-highest-notes-for-a-melody">Typical highest notes for a melody</h2>
<p>However, D5, or the D an octave and one note above middle C, is by far the most common highest note for the melody in the hymnal. 164 hymns—that’s 51.3% of the hymnal!—have this as the highest note, including <hymn>I Know That My Redeemer Lives (136)</hymn>, <hymn>I Believe in Christ (148)</hymn>, and several sacrament hymns. I can’t show all of them in a single plot, but here are the most common ones and how often they typically occur in sacrament meeting in a ward in a year.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hymns-where-the-melody-doesnt-go-very-high">Hymns where the melody doesn’t go very high</h2>
<p>The remaining 13% of the hymns have melodies that don’t go as high. There are only 6 that go up to a C♯ or D♭, including <hymn>Because I Have Been Given Much (219)</hymn>. The figure below shows all of them and how often they occur. It’s interesting that even though there are six hymns that fall into this category, two are sacrament hymns and one is a very common one. So even though they make up just 1.76% of the hymnal, they make up about 2.65% of the hymns sung in church. You’re likely to see one every 11 or so weeks on average.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>I think there are relatively few that have this particular note simply because of <a href="../../posts/key_signatures.html">what key signatures are most common</a>. It’s probably not a coincidence that one of the two hymns in D♭ are in this category. Most of the others are in A♭. If there were more hymns in D♭ major, or even A♭ we might see more hymns where the highest note is D♭5.</p>
<p>Another 30 hymns only go as high as a C5, including <hymn>Choose the Right (239)</hymn> and <hymn>Come, Follow Me (116)</hymn>. They make up 8.8% of the hymnal but 11.7% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting.</p>

</div>
<p>There are five hymns don’t ever go higher than the middle of the treble clef. The two that only go to a B4 are both pretty well known: <hymn>Secret Prayer (144)</hymn> and <hymn>Lead, Kindly Light (197)</hymn>. The only one that has B♭4 as the highest note is for men, <hymn>Ye Who Are Called to Labor (321)</hymn>, so it might not even count as a “soprano” note.</p>

<p>The lowest highest melody note is an A♭4, which is found in the rare <hymn>God Moves in a Mysterious Way (285)</hymn> and the extremely rare <hymn>Now the Day is Over (159)</hymn>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These two hymns are low enough that even a good tenor could sing the melody in the right octave! In total, there are just five hymns that don’t reach a C5, which is only 1.5% of the hymnal. And they’re rarer hymns, so they only make up 0.72% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting. So, if your highest note is a B, you might be able to sing melody once every 10 months or so. At least these lower hymns are more common that the hymns that go up to an F5 or F♯5!</p>
</section>
<section id="summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The highest note in the soprano line is an F♯5. About half of the hymns go up to D5, with many more going a little higher than that. Fewer never reach a D5. The lowest highest note in the soprano line is an A♭4.</p>
<p>Personally, singing above about a B is not easy for me. So, if I were in charge, I’d selfishly transpose many of these hymns down a bit so that their highest note is in a more comfortable range for me. But, I know many other people have no problem singing a D or even an E, so I’m not recommending that the hymnal lower any of these hymns.</p>

  <title>What hymns are sung around General Conference?</title>

<section id="general-conference-hymns" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-conference-hymns">General Conference hymns</h2>
<p>There are two hymns that stand out as “General Conference hymns”. The first is <hymn>We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19)</hymn>, which is 3.50 times more likely to be sung within a week of General Conference than all the other weeks of the year combined. The second is <hymn>Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21)</hymn> and is 2.81 times as likely to be sung within a week of General Conference than any other week.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The two most typical General Conference hymns are <hymn>We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19)</hymn> and <hymn>Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21)</hymn>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, to be clear, while the hymns are somewhat common, not all wards sing them around General Conference. Generally, <hymn>We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19)</hymn> is sung about every 37.5 weeks in a ward. But, only 28.7% of wards sing it within a week of General Conference. To put it another way, a ward might do so once every seven General Conferences. The other, <hymn>Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21)</hymn>, is less common generally and is sung once every 1.74 years, or rather, only 57% of wards will sing it in a given year. Within a week of General Conference, only 17.4% of wards will sing it, or a single ward might do it once every 5.5–6 years. So, singing General Conference hymns is not a terribly common thing.</p>
<p>We can take a closer look at the annual trends of these two General Conference hymns. General Conference takes place on the first Sunday of April and October. So, I’ve taken the dates of all the times those two hymns are sung and counted how many weeks they are until or since the nearest General Conference. I then tallied all the data, by hymn and by Conference (April vs.&nbsp;October), and produced the plot shown in Figure&nbsp;1. General Conference itself is indicated by the dotted blue line. The shaded region is around the time that is seven days or less from General Conference.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;1: Annual trends of General Conference hymns.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Here we can see that these two hymns are literally centered around General Conference. In general, <hymn>We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19)</hymn> (top panels) is the more common hymn. Around the April General Conference, it’s most common the week before, and two weeks after. In the October General Conference, it’s more common he two weeks before and one week after. Since it’s a popular hymn and a stable in LDS hymnody, it’s sung throughout the year.</p>

<p>I don’t think <hymn>We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19)</hymn> should be thought of as a hymn about prophets. Yes, the first two lines are about prophets who guide us in these latter-days. But look at the rest of the lyrics. We thank Thee for the gospel and every blessing and we want to serve Thee. The second verse is about how the Lord will deliver us. The third verse is a bit of a grabbag of topics, but prophets are not mentioned. This is not a hymn about prophets; it’s a prayer of gratitude and praise.</p>
<p>However, it has become <em>the</em> prophets hymn. I mean, look how often it’s sung in General Conference! I think the reason for this is because the first line happens to mention prophets. Although, again, it’s within the context of a prayer of gratitude.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <hymn>Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21)</hymn> (bottom panels) is less common overall. Around the April General Conference, there’s a slight increase in how often it’s sung, but not as clear of a spike. And I’m not really sure why there is a secondary spike four weeks after. There is a clearer spike after the October General Conference, and is most common two weeks before and one week after.</p>
<p>In general, the April spikes are smaller than the October spikes. This is most likely because General Conference competes with Easter in April, so wards are more likely to sing Easter hymns instead. So, around the October General Conference is when you’re most likely to hear these hymns.</p>
<p>I can glean two interesting things from Figure&nbsp;1. First, the General Conference “season” appears to start two weeks before and ends two weeks after the conference itself. I could imagine wards assigning speakers topics related to general conference (prophets, revelation, etc) leading up to it, and “what did you learn” or “what was your favorite talk” topics afterwards. Anything beyond that though, and there’s no evidence, at least in the hymns we sing, that General Conference is the focus of sacrament meeting.</p>
<p>The second interesting thing I see in Figure&nbsp;1 is something we’ll see with other holidays too: music coordinators choose the less popular hymns further from the holiday itself and the more popular ones closer to the holiday. Looking at October, we see that the largest spike in the entire figure is for <hymn>We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19)</hymn> the week before conference. Meanwhile, <hymn>Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21)</hymn> actually has a drop during that same week. It seems like music coordinators don’t want to “waste” a “good” hymn on a less-than-ideal week.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-are-these-hymns-sung-in-sacrament-meeting">When are these hymns sung in sacrament meeting?</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve established which hymns are sung and how often they are, let’s zoom into the sacrament meetings themselves. Figure&nbsp;2 shows that these two hymns are both the most common as opening hymns. Interestingly, <hymn>We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19)</hymn> is also pretty common as a closing hymn, but <hymn>Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21)</hymn> is not. I’m not sure why there’s a difference in when these two hymns are sung during sacrament, but it would be intriguing to figure out why.</p>

<p>Splitting this plot up by weeks leading up to and following General Conference, we see that the clearest trend overall is to sing <hymn>We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19)</hymn> as the opening hymn the week before General Conference. Besides that, it’s hard to point out any clear patterns, probably because we’ve stretched the data too thinly. (You can submit your ward’s data <a href="../contribute.html">here</a>!)</p>

<p>There are more than two prophet-related hymns in our hymnal, but it turns out that very few of them can be considered “General Conference hymns.” Not only are they rare generally, but also there’s no noticeable increase in frequency around General Conference. Figure&nbsp;4 shows a plot of all the hymns listed in the Topics index under the heading “Prophets,” in order of how common they are generally.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;4: Annual trends of other prophet-related hymns.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As you can see, there are no appreciable spikes around conference season. The most common, <hymn>Praise to the Man (27)</hymn> is most common earlier in the Spring, presumably around the time of the First Vision. In people’s defense, <hymn>Praise to the Man (27)</hymn> is about a particular prophet, and doesn’t seem like the most appropriate hymn for General Conference. <hymn>Come, Sing to the Lord (10)</hymn> is more about the Restoration. Most of the other hymns are just not very common any time of the year.</p>
<p>The surprise for me is how uncommon other hymns that are very clearly prophet-related, that would be no less appropriate than the two more common ones, and that are right near the other two hymns in the hymnal are. <hymn>We Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (22)</hymn> is only sung once every 4.79 years per ward, or rather only 20.9% of wards sing it in a given year. There is a slight increase in frequency around General Conference, but, going back to saving the “good” ones for the prime slot, it’s most common two weeks before the October conference and one week after. <hymn>We Ever Pray for Thee (24)</hymn> is once every 6.76 years per ward, or in only 14.8% of wards. And <hymn>God Bless Our Prophet Dear (25)</hymn> is once every 7.66 years per ward, or in only 13.1% of wards. Both of these have very small spikes around General Conference.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Even though we have several prophet-related hymns, the two most common are <hymn>We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19)</hymn> and <hymn>Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice (21)</hymn>. While they’re sung throughout the year, they’re most common within two weeks of General Conference, especially as opening hymns. April conferences are less likely to see prophet-related hymns than October conferences because of competition with Easter. Some other prophet-related hymns are very occasionally sung around the General Conference “season.”</p>

  <title>Does anyone sing the women’s and men’s arrangements?</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>At the back of the hymnal, there are 29 hymns that are designated as being for women or for men, either because of the text and/or because of the musical arrangement. This is a continuation from the previous hymnal, which contained many more arrangements, including choir pieces with special piano accompaniment. I don’t think these hymns are intended to be sung as congregational hymns in sacrament meeting and with a few exceptions, I don’t think they’re sung much at all. Let’s look a little closer at these arrangements.</p>
<section id="types-of-womens-and-mens-arrangements" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-womens-and-mens-arrangements">Types of Women’s and Men’s arrangements</h2>
<p>We can classify these hymns into a few different categories. First, we can group them based on the type of musical arrangement. Some of the hymns, like <hymn>A Key Was Turned in Latter Days (310)</hymn> or <hymn>Come, All Ye Sons of God (322)</hymn>, look like most other hymns because they’re arranged in a normal SATB format with four voices throughout. Two of the women’s hymns, <hymn>As Sisters in Zion (309)</hymn> and <hymn>We Meet Again As Sisters (311)</hymn>, look a little more like primary songs since the left hand is simplified, which makes sense because it would be somewhat strange to hear men singing either of those two. Similarly, the men’s hymn, <hymn>The Priesthood of Our Lord (320)</hymn> does not have full harmony lines written and appears that it is intended to be sung in unison. These two types of arrangements are both labeled “Women” or “Men” in the hymnal.</p>
<p>The other main type of musical arrangement is where it a special arrangement geared towards the voices of the gender they are for. For the women, this means it’s a SSA arrangement, with the alto on a separate staff as in <hymn>Love At Home (318)</hymn>. The piano gets its own lines, meaning the hymn has a total of four staves, which is potentially confusing for some people at first glance. The men get TTBB arrangements, as in <hymn>Oh Say, What Is Truth? (331)</hymn>. These are written with a tenor clef centered around C, which is essentially a treble clef but down an octave, which is intimidating at first glance and sometimes tricky to play on the piano. We could even further subdivide the men’s arrangements based on which tenor part has the melody. In most of these arrangements, the highest part has the melody, as in <hymn>Come, Come Ye Saints (326)</hymn>. For three of them though, the highest singer gets a harmony line and the melody is below that, as in <hymn>Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335)</hymn>. The women’s hymn <hymn>The Lord is My Shepherd (316)</hymn> and the men’s hymn <hymn>School Thy Feelings (336)</hymn> does a mix of these two, and the melody switches from one part to another. All of these special arrangements are labeled “Women’s Choir” or “Men’s Choir”.</p>
<p>The other way of classifying these 29 hymns is whether the hymn appears elsewhere in the hymnal or not. This classification is pretty closely correlated with the musical arrangement as well. For example, among the 10 women’s hymns, three are unique to women and don’t appear anywhere else in the hymnal; these three are also the ones arranged in a SATB-like format. The other seven women’s hymns are special arrangements of hymns that occur earlier in the hymnal in a SATB format.</p>
<p>For the men’s hymns, the correlation is not quite so tight. Of the six men’s hymns that are not full TTBB arrangements, four do not occur elsewhere in the hymnal. The last is <hymn>Rise Up, O Men of God (324)</hymn>, which has a unique melody but the same lyrics as the TTBB arrangement, <hymn>Rise Up, O Men of God (323)</hymn>, on the previous page. Of the 14 Men’s Choir arrangements, five are unique and don’t occur elsewhere in the hymnal (like <hymn>See, the Mighty Angel Flying (330)</hymn>), while the rest are arrangements of existing hymns, like <hymn>Come, Come Ye Saints (326)</hymn>, including some pretty infrequently sung hymns, like <hymn>Thy Servants Are Prepared (261)</hymn>. Then of course, <hymn>Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (336)</hymn> has unique lyrics, but the music is the same as <hymn>Should You Feel Inclined to Censure (325)</hymn>.</p>
<p>A summary of all these classifications can be found in Table&nbsp;1 and Table&nbsp;2.</p>

<p>Let’s now turn to the actual question of which of these are actually sung in sacrament meeting.</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Just two of the women’s hymns were ever sung in sacrament meeting in my sample. <hymn>As Sisters in Zion (309)</hymn> was sung eight times, which is actually more often than almost 100 other hymns. So, still quite unusual—about once every 14 years on average—but more common than many other hymns (see Figure&nbsp;1). The other women’s hymn that was sung in sacrament meeting was <hymn>Love at Home (318)</hymn>. This though was sung just one time in all my data. I don’t know the circumstances surrounding it, but I can’t help but wonder if it was a mistake and the music coordinator intended to just do Hymn 294.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Hymn 318 was actually sung in the ward next door to me, but before I moved in.

<section id="mens-arrangements" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mens-arrangements">Men’s arrangements</h2>
<p>The men’s hymns appear to have a bit more currency in sacrament meetings than the women’s hymns (see Figure&nbsp;1). Seven of these 19 hymns were sung in at least one of the sacrament meetings in my sample. The most common was <hymn>Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335)</hymn>, which was sung, on average, once every six years, or about as often as something like <hymn>That Easter Morn (198)</hymn>. Even though it is somewhat familiar to many Latter-day Saints, it would probably be somewhat confusing for some people to sing it in sacrament meeting because it is arranged such that what appears to be the “soprano” part is actually a harmony line. Next was <hymn>Ye Elders of Israel (319)</hymn>, which was sung 10 times in my sample. The others were only sung once or twice. Musically, the hymns <hymn>Come, All Ye Sons of God (322)</hymn> and <hymn>Rise Up, O Men of God (324)</hymn> are like <hymn>Ye Elders of Israel (319)</hymn> and would be less awkward to sing in church because their arrangements are perfectly fine as SATB and wouldn’t throw off the organist or the congregants. But, it would be very strange to sing <hymn>See the Mighty Priesthood Gathered (325)</hymn> and <hymn>Go, Ye Messengers of Heaven (327)</hymn> because either the melody is in the “alto” line, like <hymn>Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335)</hymn>, or the melody is too high for a typical member to sing since it is arranged for a high tenor.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-recommendations-for-the-next-hymnal" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-recommendations-for-the-next-hymnal">My recommendations for the next hymnal</h2>
<p>To summarize, very few of the women’s and men’s arrangements are sung in sacrament meeting, and those that are are rarely done so. Based on this data, I believe these hymns should probably just be removed from the hymnal. There is little reason to print tens of thousands of these 29 hymns that hardly anyone uses. As mentioned above, the previous version of the hymnal had more arrangements—some of which were full-on choir pieces—and they were removed in this 1985 edition. It makes sense to continue that trend. We don’t need to remove them completely though—I think they should be part of an online-only supplement that would be accessible through the church’s apps and website.</p>
<p>It may be the case that these hymns were kept in the hymnal with the intention of them being sung in Relief Society and Elders Quorum meetings. But now that we do not begin those meetings with hymns anymore, there is little reason to keep them. Maybe there is value in singing one of these hymns in some stake priesthood meeting or a women’s session of General Conference, and if the hymnal is treated as “canon” for what can or cannot be sung in church meetings, then it might be worth it to keep some in there simply to hold their place as canon. In my opinion though, an online supplement can serve that purpose.</p>
<p>Some of these hymns can and probably should be repurposed and brought into the main collection of hymns. For example, <hymn>Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy (335)</hymn> appears to be the most common of these 29 hymns and it would be a shame to lose it. But, there is no reason to keep it as a men’s-only arrangement: simply rearrange it as an SATB piece and I suspect it could become a more popular one.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-key-signature-is-most-common-in-the-hymnal">What key signature is most common in the hymnal?</h2>
<p>It doesn’t take any specialied skills to figure out what key signature is the most common, nothing more than flipping through the hymnal and tallying the key signatures up. To save you a sacrament meeting distraction, I went ahead did this for you, and Figure&nbsp;1 shows the distribution of key signatures across the hymnal.</p>

Fun Fact
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The most common key signature is G major, or one sharp.</p>
</div>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;1: Distribution of key signatures. See Table&nbsp;1 for exact numbers.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>If you know the hymnal well, nothing about this figure should come as a surprise. The modern hymnal tends to use key signatures that have few sharps or flats. There are about as many hymns in the D major as there are in C major and Eb major. There are slightly fewer hymns in F and Bb major for some reason. Eb major is the standout because even though it has more flats than Bb and F, it outnumbers those two. In general though, the further in the circle of fourths you go from G major, the fewer hymns there are.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">That wasn’t necessarily true of previous versions. For example, some hymns in the previous version (the blue hymnal) were in the key of E with four sharps. Presumably they got rid of those because they were too hard for some accompaniests to play.</span></div></div>
<p>Two key signatures are marginal in the hymnal. The key of A major, with three sharps, is only found in two hymns: the men’s chorus arrangement of <hymn>An Angel from on High (328)</hymn> and <hymn>How Wondrous and Great (267)</hymn>. Since the first is a men’s chorus arrangement, it was never sung in sacrament meeting in my data. The second was sung about once every 4.5–5 years, so an unusual hymn for sure, but more common than many others.</p>
<p>The other marginal key signature is Db and, again, just two hymns are in that key. <hymn>As the Shadows Fall (168)</hymn> was sung just four times in my data, or once every roughly 28 years. The other, <hymn>Softly Beams the Sacred Dawning (56)</hymn>, was sung just once in my sample, meaning it’s sung about once every 114 years. Because of how unusual these hymns are, these numbers are very rough guesses; perhaps we can think of them as “once in a generation” and “once in a lifetime.” The point is, it is <em>very</em> unusual to sing a hymn in Db.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, there is one hymn that actually changes keys partway though. <hymn>Welcome, Welcome, Sabbath Morning (280)</hymn> starts in C major, shifts to G major, and then back to C major. For the purposes of this study, I’m treating it as being in C major the entire time.</p>
</section>
<section id="but-do-we-actually-see-g-major-the-most" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-do-we-actually-see-g-major-the-most">But do we actually see G major the most?</h2>
<p>So we’ve addressed the question of what key signature the most number of hymns are set to. But, does that actually mean that’s the most that we see? What’s the difference? It may be the case that tons of hymns in G major are really obscure ones that hardly anyone ever sees. So, if we take frequency into account, perhaps another key is <em>seen</em> more often, even if fewer hymns are actually in it.</p>
<div id="fig-key_signatures_weighted" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;2: Likelihood of key signatures</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Figure&nbsp;2 looks similar to Figure&nbsp;1 except I’ve adjusted the heights of the bars based on how frequent each hymn is. If a hymn is more common, it’ll raise the bar for its key signature more. If it’s less common, it’ll raise it less.</p>
<p>While superficially the two plots may look similar, there are some important differences. (See Table&nbsp;1 as well.) First, D major is closer in height to G major. While only about 15.6% of the hymns are in D, they’re sung about 19.3% of the time. This is likely due to some pretty common sacrament hymns like <hymn>Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (196)</hymn>, <hymn>O God, the Eternal Father (175)</hymn>, and <hymn>In Memory of the Crucified (190)</hymn> as well as some other heavy hitters like <hymn>I Believe in Christ (134)</hymn> and <hymn>We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19)</hymn>.</p>
<p>Most of the other key signatures are pretty similar. C major and F major are more or less unchanged. Though 12.3% of hymns are set in Bb major, they’re only sung about 9.3% of the time. And while Ab major is only used in 6.4% of the hymns, it’s sung 5.2% of the time in sacrament meeting. (No doubt, <hymn>I Stand All Amazed (193)</hymn> is doing <a href="../posts/most_common_hymns.html">the lion’s share</a> of the work there.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest change is that Eb is quite a bit more commonly seen than you’d expect based on how many hymns there are in it. 14.3% of hymns are in Eb, but 17.4% of the hymns actually sung in sacrament meeting are in Eb. Undoubtedly, it’s because nine of the 28 sacrament hymns are in Eb. So, to put it another way, on average, hymns in Eb major are more common than hymns in C major or even Bb major.</p>
<p>Finally, the fact that the keys of A and Db major are mere slivers in Figure&nbsp;2 reflects what was explained above that they’re really uncommon.</p>
<p>To put some numbers to this, interestingly, still 22% of hymns <em>that are actually sung in sacrament meeting</em> are in the key of G. D jumps The keys of D, C, F, Bb, and Eb each have 12%–15% of the hymns. Ab is less common, with about 6% of the hymns.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;2 probably has the most useful application out of anything else in this blog post. If you’re a budding musician and are still getting used to key signatures, the good news is that you don’t have to learn all twelve keys to play the hymnal. If you focus your efforts on hymns in G, D, and Eb, you’ll get the most milage out of your practice.</p>

<section id="why-is-g-major-the-most-common" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-is-g-major-the-most-common">Why is G major the most common?</h2>
<p>I’m not a musicologist, but I can speculate as to why G is more common than C. It may be the case that many melodies are centered around the tonic, and extend roughly a fifth above it and roughly a fourth or fifth below it, with a total range of about an octave. If that’s the case, a comfortable octave for many singers is from D to D, which means the key of G would be an appropriate key signature. A good example of this is <hymn>Love One another (308)</hymn>, in the left panel of Figure&nbsp;3, which shows the distribution of notes in the melody, with the tonic highlighted in blue.</p>
<div id="fig-tonic_in_ranges" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://hymnstats.joeystanley.com/images/tonic_within_ranges.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;3: Tonic within ranges (melody lines). Tonics are highlighted in blue.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Other melodies also span a full octave but the highest and lowest notes are the tonic itself. A good example of this is <hymn>All Creatures of Our God and King (62)</hymn>, the right panel of Figure&nbsp;3. For melodies such as these, a key signature like D (or in this case, Eb) would be more appropriate so that the melody does not go too high or too low.</p>
<p>So, it may be the case then that the reason why G major is the most common key is because there are more melodies like <hymn>Love One another (308)</hymn> than like <hymn>All Creatures of Our God and King (62)</hymn>. (Looking through plots like what you see in Figure&nbsp;3 but for all the hymns in the key of G, it seems like pretty much all of them look similar to <hymn>Love One another (308)</hymn>.)</p>
<p>Along similar lines, if a piece is set to the key of G, the basses get to end the piece on a strong low note that many men, particularly men who sing bass lines, can hit. It’s nice to end a piece with the tonic being the lowest note of the bass line, and the entire hymn. Some examples of these hymns include <hymn>Do What is Right (237)</hymn> (shown in Figure&nbsp;4) and <hymn>God, Our Father, Hear Us Pray (170)</hymn>. Other hymns, such as those set in C major or Bb major, have the dominant (or fifth note of the scale) as the lowest note of the bass line, sometimes near the very end of the piece, like in <hymn>Silent Night (203)</hymn> (shown in Figure&nbsp;4) or <hymn>The Spirit of God (2)</hymn>. While dropping down to a low dominant (in this case F if it’s in the key of Bb) can be a nice way to close a piece, I think a stronger finish is to end with the lowest note being the dominant, hence the greater number of hymns set in the key of G.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Exactly five hymns are set in a minor key.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>You can see the five hymns in a minor key in Figure&nbsp;5. The most common is, perhaps unsurprisingly, <hymn>If You Could Hie to Kolob (284)</hymn> although it’s not especially frequent and is only sung about once every two and a half years or so. Next is the New Year’s Day hymn, <hymn>Ring Out, Wild Bells (215)</hymn>. We’ll talk more about holidays later on, but it’s only sung by 39% of wards around New Year’s Day. A distant third is <hymn>That Easter Morn (198)</hymn> which, from my intuition, is punching above its weight because only 16% of wards sing it around Easter. The last two, <hymn>Lord, We Come Before Thee Now (162)</hymn> and <hymn>How Long, O Lord Most Holy and True? (126) </hymn> are pretty unusual and are sung about once every 13 years and once every 60 years or so, respectively.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Although, if your ward ever does one of those musical testimony meetings where people get up and say what their favorite hymn is and then everyone sings a verse of that, I suspect you’re pretty much guaranteed to sing it then.</span></div></div>

</div>
<p>So, if you sing a hymn in a minor key, it’s probably one of the two holiday ones or <hymn>If You Could Hie to Kolob (284)</hymn>. I can’t help but think that the reason <hymn>If You Could Hie to Kolob (284)</hymn> is so popular is <em>because</em> it’s set in a minor key. It’s a pretty obscure piece of doctrine that it’s talking about and I wonder if it were set to a different tune if it’d be as popular. In other words, do people like it because of the words or because of the music? Also, for what it’s worth, the distribution of notes looks very much like <hymn>Love One another (308)</hymn> (the left panel in Figure&nbsp;3).</p>

  <title>How many unique hymns does a ward sing in a year?</title>

<section id="how-many-hymns-could-a-ward-sing-per-year" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-many-hymns-could-a-ward-sing-per-year">How many hymns <em>could</em> a ward sing per year?</h2>
<p>I was talking to someone about this project, and they said something like, “Our ward does a good job at singing unusual hymns. We probably get through the entire hymnal every year.” I can tell you now that’s impossible. Let’s explore that a little bit.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>There are 52 weeks in a year. Subtract two for General Conference and subtract two for Stake Conference. You’re left with 48 sacrament meetings per year. If you sang an opening, sacrament, intermediate, and closing hymn in all 48 of those meetings, that’s 196 hymns. But, subtract 12 for Fast Sundays, which have no intermediate hymn. So, you’re left with a maximum of 184 sung per year per ward. That’s assuming zero special musical numbers ever.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Okay, some years have 53 Sundays, but for simplicity, we’ll keep it at 52</span><span class="">For what it’s worth, I assume 48 sacrament meetings per year for everything in this project.</span></div></div>
<p>Well, right off the bat, we know that you can’t possibly get through the entire hymnal in a year, because there are 341 hymns! Even if you exclude the men’s and women’s arrangements in the back and <hymn>God Save the King</hymn>, that’s 310 hymns.</p>
<p>But, let’s not forget that sacrament hymns almost always have to be one of the hymns in the 169–196 range. There are 28 of them. We’ll assume you get through all 28 of them, but not all wards do because there are a few that are <a href="../posts/sacrament.html#frequency">clearly less popular than others</a>. So, if 48 of your 184 hymns are tied up as sacrament hymns, that means you’ll have to repeat some. That leaves 136 remaining opening, intermediate, and closing hymn slots. If you didn’t repeat any <em>and</em> had zero special musical numbers, then yes, you could sing 136 unique hymns, plus the 28 sacrament hymns, for a total of 164 unique hymns per year. That is the maximum any ward could do.</p>
<p>If you really were determined to all 310 hymns without repeating, except for sacrament hymns, it would take 94 weeks to do so, or just shy of two years, under perfect conditions. But having special musical numbers and ward choirs makes it impossible to reach that goal. I currently have 17,993 hymns from 5,345 sacrament meetings. Simple division shows that…</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip no-icon callout-titled">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Fun Fact
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The average number of hymns sung in sacrament meeting is 3.37.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That means—across my dataset—only about a third of the time will a ward sing an intermediate hymn. If, across a few weeks or months, your ward has a lower number than that, then you have more special musical numbers than a typical ward. If your average is higher, it means you have fewer.</p>
<p>Let’s recalculate our numbers then. If there are 48 weeks, and 3.37 hymns per week, that’s a max of 162 (I’ll round up) total hymns sung per ward per year. 48 of those are chewed up by the 28 sacrament hymns, so you’re left with 114 slots for the rest of the hymnal. If you didn’t repeat any and add back the 28 sacrament hymns, that’s a max of 142 unique hymns per year. And if you’re only able to get through 2.37 new hymns per week, and there are 282 non-sacrament hymns to get through, it would take 119 weeks to get through all of them, or just about two and a half years.</p>

<p>To get this number, I started off with the 20 wards from which I have at least a year’s worth of data. I didn’t want to base the calculation on wards that contributed less data because it messes with the results.</p>
<p>But, even with these 20 wards, I can’t simply divide the number of unique hymns by the number of sacrament meetings because the more data I have from a ward, the more likely they are to sing a rather unusual hymn. It pretty neatly follows some sort of exponential distribution.</p>
<p><img src="https://hymnstats.joeystanley.com/images/hymns-per-year_by_amount-of-data.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>So, because of <em>math</em>, it’s not meaningful to compare six years of data from one ward to one year of data from another ward.</p>
<p>I tried a rolling cumulative sum of unique hymns, but I didn’t know how to implement that in R. So instead, I implemented a bootstrapping technique and sampled 48 meetings, without replacement, 100 times per ward, and got that average. The standard deviation was 3.68—a surprisingly narrow distribution if you ask me.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Assuming about 24–28 of those are sacrament hymns, that means most wards only sing about 80 or so unique non-sacrament hymns per year. Furthermore, 28 of those 80 hymns are repeated each year.</p>
<p>The most variety of hymns I have in my dataset is 130 unique hymns per ward. That’s pretty good, and certainly much better than average. The year with the least variety was one ward that sang just 90 unique hymns in a year. Considering that many of the holiday hymns aren’t going to be repeated, it means that many (and perhaps most) of the non-festive hymns were repeated that year.</p>
<p>These numbers should be taken with a grain of salt because it’s only based on 20 wards. If you have access to a year’s worth of data from your ward, please visit the <a href="../contribute.html">contribute</a> page!</p>

  <title>What are the most common hymns?</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>The most common hymn is <hymn>I Stand All Amazed (193)</hymn>. Given what was discussed previously about the <a href="../posts/sacrament.html">sacrament hymns</a>, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the most common hymn is a sacrament hymn. In fact, the top 15 most sung hymns are sacrament hymns. There is a fairly well-enforced constraint that at least one hymn per meeting “must” be one of the 28 canonical sacrament hymns (with two <a href="../posts/sacrament.html#non-sacrament-hymns">“honorary hymns”</a> as possibilities as well). We can now better appreciate the list of the most common hymns.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;1: The “favorites”: Hymns that are sung at least once per year</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This figure shows nice list of 22 hymns that are probably well-known by most members of the church, like <hymn>I Know That My Redeemer Lives (136)</hymn>, <hymn>How Firm a Foundation (85)</hymn>, and <hymn>Because I Have Been Given Much (219)</hymn>. They are generic enough to be appropriate for most meetings. Their message is centered on Christ and other foundational tenents of our religion. Some are more common around certain holidays, like <hymn>Come, Come Ye Saints (30)</hymn> around Pioneer Day in Utah or <hymn>Love At Home (294)</hymn> around Mother’s Day, but they’re also general enough to be appropriate at other times of the year as well. Thus, what we see in Figure&nbsp;1 is a solid list of the most popular hymns in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;1 also shows how common each of these hymns are. <hymn>I Know That My Redeemer Lives (136)</hymn> was sung, on average, 1.72 times per year per ward, or about once every seven months. <hymn>How Firm a Foundation (85)</hymn> and <hymn>Because I Have Been Given Much (219)</hymn> were about once every 7–8 months. <hymn>Lord, I Would Follow Thee (220)</hymn>, <hymn>I Believe in Christ (134)</hymn>, and <hymn>High on the Mountain Top (5)</hymn> were once every 8–9 months. <hymn>We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (19)</hymn>, <hymn>Now Let Us Rejoice (3)</hymn>, <hymn>Love at Home (294)</hymn>, and <hymn>Teach Me to Walk in the Light (304)</hymn> were once every 9–10 months. The rest were less than once every 10 months but still at least once a year. Of course, your ward may sing these more or less often than what is shown here, but this is the average across all the wards I have data from.</p>
<p>To contrast this, some sacrament hymns are sung, on average, more than twice a year. Keep in mind that there are only 48 sacrament meetings per year, and 28 sacrament hymns to choose from, so many will have to double up. None of the non-sacrament hymns were sung, on average, more than twice a year.</p>
<p>This list of favorites is useful because if you are a new ward organist, these are the hymns to practice first. Learning these 22 hymns (plus the sacrament hymns) will get you the most mileage. In fact, these 46 hymns account for 43% of the hymns sung in sacrament meeting in this sample. That means that if you learn the hymns shown in Figure&nbsp;1, you’ll be able to play almost half of the meetings in your ward.</p>
<section id="are-these-the-standards" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-these-the-standards">Are these the “standards”?</h3>
<p>It is interesting to compare this list of the most popular hymns, which I’m calling the “favorites,” to the list in the back of the hymnal under the section “Hymns for Stake Conference” (page 381). That section lists “standard, well-known hymns” and it is implied that many members would have these hymns memorized. Interestingly, there is not a lot of overlap between these lists. Figure&nbsp;2 shows which hymns appear in Figure&nbsp;1 and are usually sung more than once a year (excluding sacrament hymns), and which are the “standards” listed in the back of the hymnal. This time, the hymns in purple are ones that are recommended as “standards” and are indeed sung pretty regularly. The blue ones are what are sung pretty often but are not one of “the standards” listed in the back of the hymnal. The red ones are recommended “standards” that are not as popular. Most of lesser-popular “standards” are still sung pretty regularly, usually at least once every two years. The exception is <hymn>Come, O Thou King of Kings (59)</hymn>, which is sung less than once every two years and is not what I would consider to be a popular hymn.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;2: Standard vs.&nbsp;Popular hymns. Here, “standard” means they’re recommended in the back of the hymnal as a well-known hymn. “Popular” means they’re sung more than once a year according to this sample. Sacrament hymns are excluded.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>However, it should be kept in mind that this isn’t exactly a fair comparison. For one, this list of “standards” is what is recommended for stake conference, which is not the same as sacrament meeting. Also, this list printed in the back of the hymnal is presumably what was recommended in 1985 when this hymnal was first published. What is considered a standard has surely changed in the past few decades. Furthermore, many of the currently most popular hymns were new additions to the 1985 hymnal, including <hymn>Because I Have Been Given Much (219)</hymn>, <hymn>I Believe in Christ (134)</hymn>, <hymn>I Am a Child of God (301)</hymn>, and <hymn>Called to Serve (249)</hymn>. It makes sense that they’re not recommended in the back of the hymnal because they were brand new when that list was published! How could they have know they’d be so popular? My recommendation for the church would be to update the list of stake conference recommendations to include these most popular hymns and to remove the ones that are less common today.</p>

  <title>What are the most and least common Sacrament Hymns?</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>We’ll start off by looking at sacrament hymns, or rather, the hymn sung immediately before the sacrament is blessed and passed to the congregation. As far as I can tell, §19.3.2 of the <em>General Handbook</em> has the only instruction about sacrament hymns, and it says that “[t]he sacrament hymn should refer to the sacrament itself or to the sacrifice of the Savior.” This instruction is repeated on page 380 of the hymnal.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>In the hymnal, sacrament hymns go from 169 (<hymn>As Now We Take the Sacrament</hymn>) to 196 (<hymn>Jesus, Once of Humble Birth</hymn>), at least according to the Table of Contents. As far as I can tell, it doesn’t <em>specifically</em> state that the sacrament hymn must be one of the 28 within that range, but I think it’s a generally accepted that that’s what that phrase from the handbook means.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">In fact, I’ve had church leaders enforce this constraint. I was in a ward where a newly-called music coordinator chose reverent hymns that were outside of that range. After about two weeks, the bishop announced that we’d be singing a different hymn than what was listed on the program and he changed it to a sacrament hymn. Presumably he later explained the policy to the chorister afterwards because we sang “true” sacrament hymns from then on.</span></div></div>
<p>As it turns out, <hymn>I Stand All Amazed (193)</hymn>, which is <a href="../posts/most_common_hymns.html">the most common hymn overall</a>, is part of that group. So it should come as no surprise that a sacrament hymn is the most common hymn overall. That one in particular focuses less on the sacrament itself and more on the Atonement, so it could be used outside of sacrament contexts without feeling out of place. In fact, a quick look at the numbers suggests that it was, in fact, sung as opening and closing hymns at least three times more often than any other sacrament hymn. This may explain why it stands out as the most commonly sung hymn in sacrament meetings.</p>
<section id="frequency" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="frequency">Frequency</h2>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the sacrament hymns themselves. In theory, if a ward were to systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns, they’d make it through all of them in a little over six months. However, Figure&nbsp;1 shows that they’re definitely not all sung equally as often as each other.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Most plots on this page are formatted just like this one here. Hymns that are less common are in the lower left and hymns that are more common are in the upper right. The numbers along the bottom refer to how many times, on average, a ward will sing that hymn within a given year.</span></div></div>

<p>Joining <hymn>I Stand All Amazed (193)</hymn> as the most common ones are <hymn>In Humility, Our Savior (172)</hymn>, <hymn>There is a Green Hill Far Away (194)</hymn>, and <hymn>Jesus, Once of Humble Birth (196)</hymn>. Each one of these is sung around two or three times per year, on average, or once every four to five months.</p>
<p>Most sacrament hymns are sung at least once a year per ward, on average, but there were some that were less common. <hymn>O Lord of Hosts (178)</hymn>, <hymn>Again, Our Dear Redeeming Lord (179)</hymn>, and <hymn>Again, We Meet around the Board (186)</hymn> each averaged somewhere between once every 13 and 17 months. The least frequent sacrament hymn though was <hymn>O Thou, Before the World Began (189)</hymn>, showing up about once every two years.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that some wards in this dataset do in fact systematically cycle through all the sacrament hymns. I recalculated the numbers without those wards (Figure&nbsp;2), and the common hymns were slightly more frequent and the uncommon ones were even rarer. For example, <hymn>O Thou, Before the World Began (189)</hymn> jumped down from once every two years to once every three years.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="non-sacrament-hymns">Non-sacrament hymns</h2>
<p>Once in a while, a ward will indeed sing some other hymn as a sacrament hymn. Many hymns were selected by at least one ward at least one time, but two stood out. They are <hymn>O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197)</hymn> and <hymn>Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146)</hymn> (Figure&nbsp;3). There is good reason for why these two were sung as sacrament hymns: if you look up “Sacrament” in the topical index in the back of the hymnal, it is a list of all the hymns from 169–196, but it also includes these two.</p>
<div id="fig-sac_plus_honoraries" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://hymnstats.joeystanley.com/images/sacrament_plus_honoraries.jpeg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;3: Sacrament hymns excluding wards that systematically cycle through them</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Let’s start with <hymn>O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197)</hymn>. It was sung as a sacrament hymn about once every four years per ward on average. Given that it feels like a sacrament hymn <em>and</em> like an Easter hymn, it is perfectly placed between the more on-the-nose sacrament hymns (i.e.&nbsp;those about the bread and water) and the more traditional Easter hymns (e.g.&nbsp;<hymn>He is Risen! (199)</hymn>). Perhaps some music coordinators noticed it in the Index and chose it because of that. But, I could see a music coordinator selecting it because they perhaps thought sacrament hymns went from 169–197 instead of 169–196.</p>
<p>The oddball though is <hymn>Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146)</hymn>. In fact, it was sung <em>as a sacrament hymn</em> about once every two years per ward, which is just about as often as <hymn>O Thou, Before the World Began (189)</hymn>. It is not clear to me why this one is listed in the index as a sacrament hymn, but it’s not grouped together with the other sacrament hymns. The “Prayer and Supplication” category of hymns, which is what this is a part of (and rightfully so, in my opinion), is just before the “Sacrament” category. If it, like <hymn>O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (197)</hymn>, fits into both categories, then I think it should be moved to hymn 168 so that it’s less out of left field. This one really should be thought of as an honorary sacrament hymn. Perhaps we’ll see it included in the “official” list of sacrament hymns in the next hymnal.</p>
</section>
<section id="sacrament-hymns-sung-elsewhere" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sacrament-hymns-sung-elsewhere">Sacrament hymns sung elsewhere</h2>
<p>Finally, we can look at sacrament hymns that were sung at some other point in a sacrament meeting. Unsurprisingly, <hymn>I Stand All Amazed (193)</hymn> is at the top, being sung occasionally as an opening hymn and closing hymn. At only once every 6–7 years, it’s not particularly common to see it sung this way, but it’s still not unheard of. After that, there are a few others like <hymn>Behold the Great Redeemer Die (191)</hymn> and <hymn>There Is a Green Hill Far Away (194)</hymn> were also used as one of the other hymns, but it was still quite unusual.</p>
<p>Overall, while singing a specific sacrament hymn elsewhere in the meeting is pretty unusual, the odds of singing <em>any</em> of the sacrament hymns is more common since their frequencies add together. It happened in 61 of the 5211 sacrament meetings I have data from, or 1.1% of them. That means, on average, a ward might since hymn 169–196 at some other point in the meeting approximately once every year and ten months.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The findings in this section suggest that were have a strong tradition of singing hymns 169 through 196 in our sacrament meetings immediately before the sacrament itself. Some wards systematically cycle through them, which I believe is a perfectly appropriate thing to do to include the widest variety of hymns to the ward. Other wards pick and choose, which inevitably leads to some favorites being sung more and some lesser-known ones falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>As we’ll see when we look at holidays, wards do not always stick to the table of contents at the beginning of the hymnal when choosing appropriate hymns. However, in the case of the sacrament—which is the most important part of our Sunday worship and the primary reason for Sunday gatherings—it’s clear that we adhere strongly to the recommendation. Nevertheless, the addition of <hymn>Gently Raise the Sacred Strain (146)</hymn> shows that there is at least some room for thinking out of the box when selecting sacrament hymns.</p>
