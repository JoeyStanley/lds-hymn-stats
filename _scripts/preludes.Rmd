I thought it'd be interesting to compile a list of prelude music that would be based on that week's *Come Follow Me* reading. I just compiled a spreadsheet with the data, but some days are a little sparse. So maybe I can fill it in with other random songs. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

```{r}
preludes <- read_excel("../data/prelude.xlsx") %>% 
    separate(`CFM Hymns`, into = letters, fill = "right") %>%
    pivot_longer(names_to = "id", values_to = "hymn", cols = letters) %>%
    filter(!is.na(hymn)) %>%
    select(-id) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    print()
```
