Compared to other Christian religions, we don't have a lot of celebration around Easter, whether in the home or in church meetings. My impression is that some members of the church are incorporating more celebratory activities for things like Palm Sunday and Good Friday, but this change is happening slowly and idiosyncratically. On Easter Sunday, the hymns we sing are usually focused on the resurrection of the Savior. In this post, I explore Easter hymns and other hymns sung around Eastertime.

This post is based primarily on `r comma(length(unique(freqs_easters$meeting_id)))` sacrament meetings from `r comma(length(unique(freqs_easters$ward)))` wards between 2001 and 2024. You can read more about the full dataset [here](/posts/frequency-data). You can read about Easter 2025, which incorporates new hymns, [here](/posts/easter2025).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
freqs_easters |> 
    filter(easter %in% c("easter", "week before", "week after", "two weeks before")) |> 
    count(meeting_id, state) |> 
    count(state, sort = TRUE)
```




## What are the Easter hymns?

From what I can tell, we have four places to look for finding Easter hymns: The Easter section in the Table of Contents (TOC), the Easter entry in the index, the resurrection entry in the index, and sacrament hymns. This figure below shows which hymns fall into which category and how they intersect.

![Easter and Easter-adjacent hymns and how they overlap](diagram.png){#fig-venn}

So, this figure shows that according to the Table of Contents, we have four Easter Hymns: <hymn>O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (#197)</hymn>, <hymn>That Easter Morn (#198)</hymn>, <hymn>He Is Risen! (#199)</hymn>, and <hymn>Christ the Lord Is Risen Today (#200)</hymn>. However, if you look up "Easter" in the Index, there are an additional nine hymns. Four of those are sacrament hymns, but there are others that are not: <hymn>All Creatures of Our God and King (#62)</hymn>, <hymn>All Glory, Laud, and Honor (#69)</hymn>, <hymn>I Believe in Christ (#134)</hymn>, <hymn>My Redeemer Lives (#135)</hymn>, and <hymn>I Know That My Redeemer Lives (#136)</hymn>. To add to that, if you look up "Resurrection" in the Index, there are an additional four hymns not included elsewhere: <hymn>Lo, the Mighty God Appearing! (#55)</hymn>, <hymn>Lord, Accept Our True Devotion (#107)</hymn>, <hymn>Though Deepening Trials (#122)</hymn>, and <hymn>The Glorious Gospel Light Has Shone (#283)</hymn>. Sprinkled among these lists are four sacrament hymns: <hymn>While of These Emblems We Partake (#173)</hymn>, <hymn>While of These Emblems We Partake (#174)</hymn>, <hymn>Behold the Great Redeemer Die (#191)</hymn>, and <hymn>He Died! The Great Redeemer Died (#192)</hymn>. And, since the Last Supper happened during Holy Week, any sacrament hymn would probably be appropriate for Palm Sunday or Easter. So, while that initial list of four Easter hymns was small, when expanded to include adjacent topics, the list can get pretty long!

```{r}
easter_toc <- 197:200
easter_index <- c(62, 69, 134:136, 173:174, 191:192, 197:200)
resurrection_index <- c(55, 107, 122, 135:136, 173:174, 191:192, 198:200, 283)
sacrament_index <- c(146, 169:197)
all_easter_hymns <- c(easter_toc, easter_index, resurrection_index)

# These ones are Easter but not Resurrection
setdiff(easter_index, resurrection_index)

# These ones are Resurrection but not Easter
setdiff(resurrection_index, easter_index)
```

So, for the remainder of this post, I'll focus on that set of hymns. 

```{r}
bind_rows(data.frame(easter_toc = easter_toc),
          data.frame(easter_index = easter_index),
          data.frame(ressurrection = resurrection_index),
          data.frame(sacrament = sacrament_index))  |> 
    rowid_to_column("id") |>
    pivot_longer(cols = -id, names_to = "category", values_to = "hymn_num") |>
    filter(!is.na(hymn_num)) |>
    pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = id) |>
    arrange(hymn_num) |>
    print()
```


## When are Easter hymns sung?

While figuring out the exact date of when Easter will be [can be calculated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_Easter), it is a lot easier to just get a list of when Easter was from 2002 to 2024 and look at sacrament meetings relative to those dates. So I just took that list of dates and looked at hymns relative to them. This means, unlike my post on [Fast Sundays](/posts/fast_sunday), which were pretty approximate, here I've got a pretty accurate look at Easter.

If we focus on the period from about six weeks before Easter to two weeks after, we can see how many wards since any of the hymns shown in @fig-venn each week. @fig-weeks_around_easter shows these numbers. As you can see, there is obviously a spike on Easter itself and a whopping 98.3% of wards sing at least one Easter hymn on Easter Sunday. But, there seems to be a fair number of Easter hymns sung even six weeks before.

```{r}
sacs_with_easter <- freqs |> 
    mutate(is_easter = hymn_num %in% all_easter_hymns) |> 
    summarize(n_easters = sum(is_easter) > 0, .by = c(meeting_id, week)) |>
    count(n_easters, week) |>
    pivot_wider(names_from = n_easters, values_from = n) |> 
    mutate(prop_easter = `TRUE`/sum(c(`TRUE`, `FALSE`)), .by = week) |> 
    print()
```

```{r, include = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
#| fig-cap: Percentage of sacrament meetings with Easter hymns around Easter
#| label: fig-weeks_around_easter
freqs_easters |> 
    mutate(is_easter = hymn_num %in% all_easter_hymns) |> 
    summarize(has_easter = sum(is_easter) > 0, .by = c(meeting_id, easter)) |>
    filter(easter != "not Easter") |>
    count(easter, has_easter) |> 
    pivot_wider(names_from = has_easter, values_from = n) |>
    mutate(prop_easter = `TRUE`/sum(c(`TRUE`, `FALSE`)), .by = easter) |>
    mutate(rel_week = as.numeric(easter) - 7) |>
    ggplot(aes(rel_week, prop_easter)) + 
    geom_col() + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10) + 
    scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(0, c(0, 0.02)),
                       minor_breaks = seq(0, 100, 0.05),
                       labels = scales::percent) + 
    labs(title = "Percentage of sacrament meetings with Easter hymns around Easter",
         subtitle = "\"0\" is Easter Sunday, \"-1\" is one week before, \"-2\" is two weeks before, etc.",
         x = "week relative to Easter",
         y = "percentage of sacrament meetings") + 
    theme_minimal()
```

But, hold on a second. Before we pat ourselves on the back for singing Easter hymns as much as six weeks before the holiday, let's take a closer look at the data. These "Easter" hymns include a fair number of regular hymns that would be perfectly appropriate in other weeks of the year. Obviously the four sacrament hymns are sung outside of the Easter season (like <hymn>I Believe in Christ (#134)</hymn>), and some of these hymns (like <hymn>I Know That My Redeemer Lives (#136)</hymn>) are common during [Fast and Testimony meeting](/posts/fast_sunday). 

So, to get a gauge for how often these supposed Easter hymns are sung, I looked at how many of these were sung during weeks that aren't influenced by major holidays. (See details below if you'd like.) 

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Technical details

First, here is a plot showing the proportion of sacrament meetings in my dataset that have at least one "Easter" hymn across the year.

```{r, include = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(sacs_with_easter, aes(week, prop_easter)) + 
    geom_col() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)) + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
    labs(title = "Percentage of sacrament meetings with Easter hymns by week number",
         x = "Week number",
         y = "Percentage of sacrament meetings") + 
    theme_minimal()
```

There is an obvious peak around Easter, but Easter varies across years, so it's a little spread out. There's also a noticeable dip towards the end of the year as we sing more [Christmas](/posts/christmas) hymns. But, the rest of the year is pretty consistent, with maybe a slight dip in the summer.

Again, to get an idea of the number of "Easter" hymns, I decided to look at the following:

* The second through fifth weeks of the year, which is January 8 through February 4. This avoids residual [New Year's Day](/posts/new-years) hymns and is before when [Valentine's Day](/posts/valentines) hymns might be sung. 
* The 22nd and 23rd weeks of the year, which is May 22 through June 10th, which is after Mother's Day and before Father's Day.
* The 32nd through 38th weeks of the year, which corresponds to August 5 through September 23. There are no major holidays during that period. It's after Pioneer Day (in Utah) and before when [General Conference](/posts/general_conference) hymns pick up. 

I acknowledge that this is very US-centric, but since [around 85% of my data](/posts/frequency-data) comes from the US, I guess I'm considering the influence of other countries to be somewhat negligible for this basic calculation. 

With that in mind, here's the same plot as above, but with those weeks highlighted.

```{r, include = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
sacs_with_easter |> 
    mutate(in_range = week %in% c(2:5, 22:23, 32:38)) |> 
    ggplot(aes(week, prop_easter, fill = in_range)) + 
    geom_col() + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)) + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
    scale_fill_manual(breaks = c("TRUE", "FALSE"),
                     values = c(ptol_blue, "gray75")) +
    labs(title = "Percentage of sacrament meetings with Easter hymns by week number",
         subtitle = "Non-holiday weeks are highlighted in <span style = 'color: #4477AA;'>blue</span>",
         x = "week number",
         y = "Percentage of sacrament meetings") + 
    theme_minimal() + 
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown())
```

Anyway, the purpose of all this avoidance of holidays is to get the typical percentage of sacrament meetings that contain one or more of these "Easter" hymns during times when you wouldn't expect them. Basically, get a baseline. As it turns out, the average percentage of sacrament meetings was 19.9%. On the upper end is about 24.5%. 

```{r}
sacs_with_easter |> 
    mutate(in_range = week %in% c(2:5, 22:23, 32:38)) |> 
    filter(in_range) |> 
    pull(prop_easter) |> 
    quantile(c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.8, 0.9, 12/13))
```

So, we'll round up and say the baseline is 25% of sacrament meetings. So, that means that we can consider any week around Eastertime where more than 25% of wards sing "Easter" hymns as being more than normal and indicative of wards singing these hymns to celebrate Easter. 
:::


It turns out it's around 25% of wards per week. So, if we go back to @fig-weeks_around_easter, we can highlight all the weeks that have more than 25% of sacrament meetings. @fig-weeks_around_easter_highlighted shows the result:

```{r, include = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
#| fig-cap: Percentage of sacrament meetings with Easter hymns around Easter
#| label: fig-weeks_around_easter_highlighted
freqs_easters |> 
    mutate(is_easter = hymn_num %in% all_easter_hymns) |> 
    summarize(has_easter = sum(is_easter) > 0, .by = c(meeting_id, easter)) |>
    filter(easter != "not Easter") |>
    count(easter, has_easter) |> 
    pivot_wider(names_from = has_easter, values_from = n) |>
    mutate(prop_easter = `TRUE`/sum(c(`TRUE`, `FALSE`)), .by = easter) |>
    mutate(rel_week = as.numeric(easter) - 7) |>
    ggplot(aes(rel_week, prop_easter, fill = prop_easter > 0.25)) + 
    geom_col() + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.25, color = "gray50", linetype = "dashed") + 
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10) + 
    scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(0, c(0, 0.02)),
                       minor_breaks = seq(0, 100, 0.05),
                       labels = scales::percent) + 
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("gray75", "#bebada")) + 
    labs(title = "Percentage of sacrament meetings with Easter hymns around Easter",
         subtitle = "Weeks in <span style = 'color: #bebada;'>purple</span> are when Easter hymns are sung more than normal",
         x = "week relative to Easter",
         y = "percentage of sacrament meetings") + 
    theme_minimal() + 
    theme(legend.position = "none", 
          plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown())
```

As it turns out, in Latter-day Saint congregations, between three weeks before and the week after Easter have a greater number of Easter hymns than a typical week. Even then, three and two weeks before are only marginally more Eastery than other weeks. All the other weeks are under the threshold for what is considered normal and have no more "Easter" hymns than any other week of the year. To me, this is unsurprising and matches pretty much any other holiday that we sing about in our church. It's also interesting to see that, for a holiday we consider most important, it's actually reflected in our hymns far less than it is in other Christian worship services.

### Tangent about Easter Sundays without any Easter hymns

Up above, I showed that 98.3% of wards sing at least one Easter hymn on Easter Sunday. That means there are, very occasionally, wards that don't. What did they sing? In my data, there were exactly twelve such Easter Sundays. For four of them, I'm missing some of the data, so it's very possible that they did in fact sing an Easter hymn then. Here are some examples of what some of the remaining wards did on Easter:

```{r}
noneaster_easters <- freqs_easters |> 
    mutate(is_easter = hymn_num %in% all_easter_hymns) |> 
    summarize(has_easter = sum(is_easter) > 0, .by = c(meeting_id, easter)) |>
    filter(easter == "easter",
           !has_easter) |> 
    pull(meeting_id)
noneaster_easters

freqs_easters |> 
    filter(meeting_id %in% noneaster_easters)
freqs_easters |> 
    filter(meeting_id %in% noneaster_easters) |> 
    select(ward, date, type, name_num) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = name_num, 
                values_fn = ~paste(., collapse=" & ")) |> 
    select(ward, date, Opening, Sacrament, Intermediate, Closing)
```

* In 2007, a ward in Iowa sang <hymn>Praise to the Man (#27)</hymn>, <hymn>There Is a Green Hill Far Away (#194)</hymn>, and <hymn>How Gentle God's Commands (#125)</hymn>. The first is perhaps in reference to the First Vision, and the second is essentially an honorary Easter sacrament hymn.
* In 2017, a ward in Weber County, Utah sang <hymn>High on the Mountain Top (#5)</hymn>, <hymn>O God, the Eternal Father (#175)</hymn>, and <hymn>Hark, All Ye Nations! (#264)</hymn>. It's not clear what the motivations for those were. Perhaps they had a musical number that was an Easter hymn.
* In 2022, a ward in Salt Lake County, Utah sang <hymn>I Am a Child of God (#301)</hymn>, <hymn>I Stand All Amazed (#193)</hymn>, and <hymn>Teach Me to Walk in the Light (304)</hymn>. I wonder if they wanted to sing hymns the children would know on Easter. 

So, it does happen. But not very often!

## What's sung around Easter?

Now that we've established which hymns are Easter hymns and when those hymns are sung relative to Easter, let's answer the questions of *which* of these Easter hymns are sung *when*. 


### When are hymns sung within the Easter season?

First, we'll start off by looking from the perspective of the hymns themselves. If we just focus on the Sundays from three weeks before through one week after, given that any particular hymn is sung, when is that hymn likely going to be sung? It turns out that all 17 of the hymns that could be considered Easter hymns were indeed sung in the Easter season in my database, though obviously some were far less common than others. @fig-cleveland shows these 17 hymns in order of frequency and how often they are sung in a ward in a given year.

```{r, include = TRUE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, message=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: Percentage of wards that sing each Easter hymn per year
#| label: fig-cleveland
freqs_easters |> 
    filter(easter %in% c("easter", "week before", "week after", "two weeks before")) |> 
    cleveland(stat_to_plot = sum_prop_wards, 
              hymns_to_plot = all_easter_hymns) + 
    labs(title = "Percentage of wards that sing each Easter hymn per year",
         subtitle = "Between two weeks before and a week after Easter") + 
    scale_x_continuous(name = "percent of wards",
                       labels = percent,
                       expand = expansion(0, c(0, 0.2)),
                       breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1),
                       minor_breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.05))
```

We can immediately see that <hymn>He Is Risen! (#199)</hymn> and <hymn>Christ the Lord is Risen Today (#200)</hymn> are far and away the most common hymns during this time, with the former just slightly ahead. I'm honestly surprised that more wards aren't singing those hymns! But, like what we saw with the [Christmas](/posts/christmas) hymns, it's very possible that many more wards *hear* these hymns each year just as musical numbers of some sort, rather than as a congregational hymn. 

Let's dive into each of those hymns then and see when during that five-week period they're sung. @fig-rel_freq shows how often each Easter hymn is sung across the Easter season. In this plot, the percentages add up to 100% for each hymn, regardless of how often the hymn is sung generally, so it's not necessarily meaningful to compare across hymns. Instead, we focus on each hymn and see when it peaks within the Easter season.

```{r, include = TRUE, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8, message=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: Relative frequency of Easter hymns across the Easter season
#| label: fig-rel_freq
freqs_easters |>

           hymn_num %in% all_easter_hymns) |>
    mutate(easter = as.numeric(easter) - 7) |> 
    count(easter, hymn_name, hymn_num, name_num) |>

There are a few interesting patterns here. For one, the very infrequent hymns, <hymn>Lo, the Mighty God Appearing (#55)</hymn> and <hymn>The Glorious Gospel Light Has Shone (#283)</hymn>, don't appear to be sung on Easter itself, but it's important to keep in mind that both of those were extremely rare in the Easter season in my database, so we shouldn't draw too many strong conclusions about those. Meanwhile, the most quinticessential Easter hymns peak on Easter Sunday itself.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, most hymns peak on Easter day itself. The notable exception is <hymn>All Glory, Laud, and Honor (#69)</hymn>. It is a Palm Sunday hymn, so it is appropriate that it is most common on Palm Sunday. (I personally didn't know that before putting together this blog post, so I'm glad other people are aware of it!) We also see that <hymn>All Creatures of Our God and King (#62)</hymn> and <hymn>My Redeemer Lives (#135)</hymn> peak on Palm Sunday. From what I can tell, all other hymns are most common on Easter Sunday.

### What hymns are most common each week?

We can look at the same data a slightly different way and focus on one week at a time. We'll start with Pqlm Sunday. We just mentioned above that <hymn>All Glory, Laud, and Honor (#69)</hymn> shows a very clear peak the week before Easter. Is it the most common hymn on Palm Sunday? @fig-cleveland_palm shows that it is actually not. 

```{r, include = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, message=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: Most common hymns on Palm Sunday
#| label: fig-cleveland_palm
palm_sunday <- freqs_easters |>
    filter(easter %in% c("week before")) |> 
    mutate(is_easter = hymn_num %in% all_easter_hymns)
palm_sunday_dates <- palm_sunday |> 
    distinct(month, day) |> 
    nrow()
palm_sunday |>
    cleveland(filter_n = 20, 
              col_to_plot = sum_prop_wards,
              n_weeks = palm_sunday_dates/7,
              extra_cols = is_easter,
              color = is_easter,
              return = "plot") + 
    labs(title = "Frequency of hymns on Palm Sunday",
         subtitle = "Easter hymns are highlighted in <span style = 'color: #4477AA;'>blue</span>") +
    scale_x_continuous(name = "percent",
                       labels = scales::percent,
                       expand = expansion(0, c(0, 0.04)),
                       breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.02)) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c(`TRUE` = ptol_blue, `FALSE` = ptol_grey)) +
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown())
```

Several other hymns are simply more common than <hymn>All Glory, Laud, and Honor (#69)</hymn> overall, so even though a hymn like <hymn>He is Risen! (#199)</hymn> is much more common on Easter than on Palm Sunday, the sheer fact that it's sung so much more in general means that even when it's not at its peak, it's still more common than <hymn>All Glory, Laud, and Honor (#69)</hymn> on its peak. Palm Sunday also has competition with [General Conference](/posts/general_conference), so <hymn>We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet (#19), even wins out on Palm Sunday. Overall, only 6.4% of wards sung <hymn>All Glory, Laud, and Honor (#69)</hymn> on Palm Sunday.

Let's go back one week and look at two Sundays before Easter. @fig-cleveland_two_before shows what hymns are most common then. 

```{r, include = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, message=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: Most common hymns two weeks before Easter Sunday

freqs_easters |>
    filter(easter %in% c("two weeks before")) |> 
    mutate(is_easter = hymn_num %in% all_easter_hymns) |> 
    cleveland(col_to_plot = sum_prop_wards,
                   filter_n = 15,
                   n_weeks = 1,
                   extra_cols = is_easter,
                   color = is_easter,
                   return = "plot") + 
    scale_x_continuous(name = "percent of wards",
                       labels = percent,
                       expand = expansion(0, c(0, 0.03)),
                       breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.01)) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c(`TRUE` = ptol_blue, `FALSE` = ptol_grey)) + 
    labs(title = "Frequency of hymns two weeks before Easter",
                   subtitle = "Easter hymns are highlighted in <span style = 'color: #4477AA;'>blue</span>") + 
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown())
```

You can immediately see that there really aren't many Easter hymns during this week. I think it's pretty clear than that in Latter-day Saint congregations, celebrating Easter does not include singing Easter hymns two weeks before Easter Sunday.


We now move on to Easter Sunday itself. @fig-cleveland_easter show the most commonly sung hymns on Easter. This looks similar to @fig-cleveland, but here we're just looking at Easter Sunday but we're expanding it to include all hymns, regardless of whether they're "technically" Easter hymns. 

```{r, include = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, message=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: Most common hymns on Easter Sunday
#| label: fig-cleveland_easter
freqs_easters |>
    filter(easter %in% c("easter")) |> 
    mutate(is_easter = hymn_num %in% all_easter_hymns) |> 
    cleveland(col_to_plot = sum_prop_wards,
              n_weeks = 1,
              filter_n = 15,
              extra_cols = is_easter,
              color = is_easter) + 
    scale_x_continuous(name = "percent of wards",
                       labels = scales::percent,
                       expand = expansion(0, c(0, 0.35)),
                       breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1),
                       minor_breaks = seq(0, 0, 0.05)) +
    labs(title = "Frequency of hymns on Easter Sunday",
        subtitle = "Easter hymns are highlighted in <span style = 'color: #4477AA;'>blue</span>") + 
    scale_color_manual(values = c(`TRUE` = ptol_blue, `FALSE` = ptol_grey)) + 
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown())
```

Here we see that all the hymns on this list are Easter hymns as discussed above or are Sacrament hymns. It's been hinted at already, but it's clear that the bulk of Easter singing happens on Easter. As is evident in this plot, Easter hymns dominate on Easter Sunday, and as we saw already in @fig-weeks_around_easter, 98.6% of wards sing at least one Easter hymn that week.

Like what we've seen already, <hymn>Christ the Lord Is Risen Today (#200)</hymn> and <hymn>He Is Risen! (#199)</hymn> are by far the most common. Interestingly, when we look at the Easter season as a whole, the two are about equal, with <hymn>He Is Risen! (#199)</hymn> having a very slight lead. But on Easter Sunday itself, <hymn>Christ the Lord Is Risen Today (#200)</hymn> is slightly more common. Going back to @fig-rel_freq, we can see that it has perhaps a stronger, more concentrated peak on Easter, while <hymn>He Is Risen! (#199)</hymn> is slightly more common on Palm Sunday and the week after.

```{r}
freqs_easters |>
    filter(easter %in% c("easter")) |> 
    cleveland(col_to_plot = sum_prop_wards,
              n_weeks = 1,
              filter_n = 7,
              return = "table")
```


The two other most canonical Easter hymns, <hymn>That Easter Morn (#198)</hymn> and <hymn>O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown (#197)</hymn>, are less common, being sung by 20.4% and 6.6% of wards each year on Easter, respectively. Most of the rest of the hymns on this list are sacrament hymns. The four sacrament hymns listed in the Easter entry of the Index are the most common, with the exception of <hymn>There is a Green Hill Far Away (#194)</hymn>, which has clear reference to the crucifixion. As for the other hymns, <hymn>I Know that My Redeemer Lives (#136)</hymn>, <hymn>All Creatures of Our God and King (#62)</hymn>, and <hymn>I Believe in Christ (#134)</hymn> are the only others on this list. 

So, it seems like music coordinators are primarily choosing from the hymns listed in the Easter entry of the Table of Contents or the Index. What we do not see on this list are any of the four hymns that are listed in the Resurrection entry in the Index that are not also part of the Easter entry (i.e. the green portion of @fig-venn that does not overlap with the blue portion).

Finally, let's look at the week after Easter. @fig-cleveland_week_after shows that there are far fewer Easter hymns. <hymn>He is Risen! (#199)</hymn> is still quite popular, with <hymn>Christ the Lord Is Risen Today (#200)</hymn> trailing behind a bit more. All the other "Easter" hymns on this list are either sacrament hymns or are popular in other contexts (like [Fast Sunday](/posts/fast_sunday)). The rest of the top 10 hymns are other sacrament hymns and below that are a mix of more [General Conference](/posts/general_conference) hymns, First Vision hymns, or generally popular hymns. So, like what we saw in @fig-weeks_around_easter_highlighted, there are some residual Easter hymns being sung, but for the most part, people have moved on. 

```{r, include = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, message=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: Most common hymns on the Sunday after Easter
#| label: fig-cleveland_week_after
freqs_easters |>
    filter(easter %in% c("week after")) |> 
    mutate(is_easter = hymn_num %in% all_easter_hymns) |> 
    cleveland(stat_to_plot = sum_prop_wards,
              filter_n = 17,
              extra_cols = is_easter,
              color = is_easter) + 
    scale_x_continuous(name = "percent of wards", 
                       labels = scales::percent, 
                       expand = expansion(0, c(0, 0.03)),
                       breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.02)) + 
    scale_color_manual(values = c(`TRUE` = ptol_blue, `FALSE` = ptol_grey)) + 
    labs(title = "Most popular hymns on the Sunday after Easter",
         subtitle = "Easter hymns are highlighted in <span style = 'color: #4477AA;'>blue</span>") + 
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          plot.subtitle = ggtext::element_markdown())
```

One final thing we can explore with these hymns is when during sacrament meeting they're sung. By that, I mean are they opening hymns, intermediate hymns, or closing hymns? Here, I'll just focus on the two hymns that have clearly shown to be the most popular: <hymn>He Is Risen! (#199)</hymn> and <hymn>Christ the Lord is Risen Today (#200)</hymn>. We've already seen that the two are basically neck-and-neck in popularity, and the only difference we've seen between them is that <hymn>Christ the Lord is Risen Today (#200)</hymn> is slightly more popular on Easter Sunday and while <hymn>He Is Risen! (#199)</hymn> is slightly more popular on neighboring weeks. Are there any differences within the meeting itself?

@fig-types shows the number of times each of these two hymns were sung as opening, intermediate, and closing hymns between two weeks before Easter to a week after. The two hymns are very similar! They're almost evenly split between opening and closing hymns, with opening being slightly more common. They're occasionally sung as intermediate hymns, but not too often. <hymn>Christ the Lord is Risen Today (#200)</hymn> is slightly more popular as an opening hymn while <hymn>He Is Risen! (#199)</hymn> is slightly more commonly a closing hymn. It seems then that the most common thing that music coordinators do is they pick one to be the opening hymn and the other to be the closing hymn. 

```{r, include = TRUE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 8}
#| fig-cap: When are the top two Easter hymns sung in Sacrament meeting?

    filter(easter %in% c("easter", "week before", "week after", "two weeks before"),
           hymn_num %in% c(199, 200),
           !is.na(type),
           type != "Sacrament") |> 
    ggplot(aes(type, fill = hymn_name)) + 
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge2()) + 
    scale_fill_ptol(name = "Hymn") + 
    labs(title = "When are the two most popular Easter hymns sung in the meeting?",
         y = "count") + 
    theme_bw()
```

## Summary

In this post, I've explored Easter hymns. First, I defined a list of potential Easter hymns by looking at relevant topics in the Index and Table of Contents and found a list of 17 hymns. I then determined when the Easter "season" is, as far as how it's reflected in singing, and determined that two weeks before through one week after is when we see a noticeable increase in Easter hymns, above and beyond what is to be expected. As part of that, I showed that 98.6% of wards sing at least one Easter hymn on Easter Sunday itself, which is pretty remarkable. 

I then looked at each hymn and found that most hymns peak on Easter Sunday, with the most notable exception being <hymn>All Glory, Laud, and Honor (#69)</hymn>, which peaks on Palm Sunday. It is clear that <hymn>He Is Risen! (#199)</hymn> and <hymn>Christ the Lord is Risen Today (#200)</hymn> are the most common hymns around Easter. Other than the latter being slightly more concentrated on Easter Sunday itself, the two pattern almost identically which suggests that music coordinators basically treat them the same. 

I hope the next hymnal introduces more Easter hymns because I think we as Latter-day Saints could do more to celebrate Easter. Because we mostly celebrate the Resurrection on Easter Sunday itself, and because there are so few hymns to choose from,
