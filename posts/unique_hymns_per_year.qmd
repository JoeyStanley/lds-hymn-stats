## How many hymns *could* a ward sing per year?

I was talking to someone about this project, and they said something like, "Our ward does a good job at singing unusual hymns. We probably get through the entire hymnal every year." I can tell you now that's impossible. Let's explore that a little bit.

There are 52 weeks in a year.[Okay, some years have 53 Sundays, but for simplicity, we'll keep it at 52]{.aside} Subtract two for General Conference and subtract two for Stake Conference. You're left with 48 sacrament meetings per year.[For what it's worth, I assume 48 sacrament meetings per year for everything in this project.]{.aside} If you sang an opening, sacrament, intermediate, and closing hymn in all 48 of those meetings, that's 196 hymns. But, subtract 12 for Fast Sundays, which have no intermediate hymn. So, you're left with a maximum of 184 sung per year per ward. That's assuming zero special musical numbers ever. 

Well, right off the bat, we know that you can't possibly get through the entire hymnal in a year, because there are 341 hymns! Even if you exclude the men's and women's arrangements in the back and <hymn>God Save the King</hymn>, that's 310 hymns. 

But, let's not forget that sacrament hymns almost always have to be one of the hymns in the 169--196 range. There are 28 of them. We'll assume you get through all 28 of them, but not all wards do because there are a few that are [clearly less popular than others](/posts/sacrament.qmd#frequency). So, if 48 of your 184 hymns are tied up as sacrament hymns, that means you'll have to repeat some. That leaves 136 remaining opening, intermediate, and closing hymn slots. If you didn't repeat any *and* had zero special musical numbers, then yes, you could sing 136 unique hymns, plus the 28 sacrament hymns, for a total of 164 unique hymns per year. That is the maximum any ward could do. 

If you really were determined to all 310 hymns without repeating, except for sacrament hymns, it would take 94 weeks to do so, or just shy of two years, under perfect conditions. But having special musical numbers and ward choirs makes it impossible to reach that goal. I currently have 17,993 hymns from 5,345 sacrament meetings. Simple division shows thatâ€¦

### Fun Fact
The average number of hymns sung in sacrament meeting is 3.37.

That means---across my dataset---only about a third of the time will a ward sing an intermediate hymn. If, across a few weeks or months, your ward has a lower number than that, then you have more special musical numbers than a typical ward. If your average is higher, it means you have fewer. 

Let's recalculate our numbers then. If there are 48 weeks, and 3.37 hymns per week, that's a max of 162 (I'll round up) total hymns sung per ward per year. 48 of those are chewed up by the 28 sacrament hymns, so you're left with 114 slots for the rest of the hymnal. If you didn't repeat any and add back the 28 sacrament hymns, that's a max of 142 unique hymns per year. And if you're only able to get through 2.37 new hymns per week, and there are 282 non-sacrament hymns to get through, it would take 119 weeks to get through all of them, or just about two and a half years.

## So how many hymns *do* wards sing per year?

### Fun Fact
Most wards sing around 107 unique hymns per year.

### Technical details for nerds :)
To get this number, I started off with the 20 wards from which I have at least a year's worth of data. I didn't want to base the calculation on wards that contributed less data because it messes with the results. 

But, even with these 20 wards, I can't simply divide the number of unique hymns by the number of sacrament meetings because the more data I have from a ward, the more likely they are to sing a rather unusual hymn. It pretty neatly follows some sort of exponential distribution.

So, because of *math*, it's not meaningful to compare six years of data from one ward to one year of data from another ward. 

I tried a rolling cumulative sum of unique hymns, but I didn't know how to implement that in R. So instead, I implemented a bootstrapping technique and sampled 48 meetings, without replacement, 100 times per ward, and got that average. The standard deviation was 3.68---a surprisingly narrow distribution if you ask me.
:::

Assuming about 24--28 of those are sacrament hymns, that means most wards only sing about 80 or so unique non-sacrament hymns per year. Furthermore, 28 of those 80 hymns are repeated each year. 

The most variety of hymns I have in my dataset is 130 unique hymns per ward. That's pretty good, and certainly much better than average. The year with the least variety was one ward that sang just 90 unique hymns in a year. Considering that many of the holiday hymns aren't going to be repeated, it means that many (and perhaps most) of the non-festive hymns were repeated that year. 

These numbers should be taken with a grain of salt because it's only based on 20 wards. If you have access to a year's worth of data from your ward, please visit the [contribute](/contribute.qmd) page!
